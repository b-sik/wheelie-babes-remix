It was even better from outside in the cold mountain air, which we discovered only because we had to go outside to get to the dining room where breakfast was waiting. We ate around the fruit that mice had discovered overnight. <figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/6B80507A-CE36-4BA5-A096-2E991EA6A412-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/0FBDC362-109E-450A-9699-705BDD58FC1C-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/B82FFA44-3102-4BBB-A2C0-B6F6627D49FA-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Surprisingly, it was already pretty warm when we were leaving Caples Lake. I&rsquo;d forgotten to put on sunscreen the day before and paid the price, so today I put on the only kind we had left which is impossible to rub in.

There were huge swaths of forest that had clearly burned recently along our route. We tried to imagine what it would be like to ride there during a forest fire. Pretty hot, I think.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/6C386EE2-E544-4112-93C2-2C015599E2E9-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/C27D7B78-0ECE-4AD9-9977-21EBD9682DA2-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/57D63BAC-3CA2-417E-ACE9-C20E7B2F309A-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/BC51FE42-4253-4BA6-82B5-1FDD6EE0991C-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>The descents were long and exhilarating.

Crazy to think that people going east on this route had to deal with this road in reverse. The road quality wasn&rsquo;t perfect, but avoiding the bumps and potholes felt like a video game.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/839025F9-7E4F-45B7-B92F-BA1366FA4FB0-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.9D8FDE30-F780-4A8D-BDF0-86478E153FA0.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><p>Pines and granite gradually turned to grapevines and dry soil. The temperature had gone up at least 15 degrees as well. We must have passed almost 100 vineyards and wineries on our way to Plymouth. We longed to stop for a tasting but thought it wouldn&rsquo;t be smart with miles left to go. We hoped car drivers on the road hadn&rsquo;t been imbibing.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/0CCDC23A-2DBB-4297-B478-EC6769230B0A-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/D3106CCF-E382-4A1F-9CD1-5BE1B7139AB2-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/972FCB56-644B-44E3-8B5B-C089D6C5EF84-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/85DA5285-066B-42F6-897C-176CFDF2FC1A-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We rolled into Plymouth mid-afternoon and headed to our Airbnb. We&rsquo;d canceled on our Warmshowers host (again), this time because Plymouth was better situated between Kirkwood and Sacramento than Rancho Murieta. We didn&rsquo;t regret stopping 15 miles sooner. The town was small and lovely, as was the little apartment we&rsquo;d booked. After a shower and nap, we headed down the road on our bikes to a Mexican restaurant. That evening we watched the movie IT, and got nice and spooked. We double-checked the lock before we went to sleep.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/180AE767-4D50-4A0E-84B3-ECFB2B1E2B48-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/BADE02DC-6BED-4B1E-8E24-A907D034E4E6-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/A74327C0-A394-49E4-BFCC-CEF2CEBDEA92-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.82D7E396-2DA3-4BE0-AF45-BB8F0A311245.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/DC8939F7-4C34-4FAF-913A-7B8DAC6F2B87-1024x768.webp\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><\/p>","date":"October 21, 2022","fields":{"date":"10\/18\/2022","day_number":"102","multiple_days":false,"weather":"Partly Sunny","locations":{"single":false,"start":"Kirkwood, CA","end":"Plymouth, CA"},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"60","elevation_gain":"3533","elevation_loss":"10289","flats":""}}}
