{"ID":1612,"title":"Day 65 &#8211; Blue Mesa Reservoir, CO to Cimarron, CO","content":"<p>Another cold one when we woke up. It was so calming seeing and hearing the water as we had our breakfast. We&rsquo;d not been near such a large body of water in a long time. Cold in the tent, I learned the biking hat that I&rsquo;d found left behind in Sebree, Kentucky is too small for my head.<figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/3C816513-1D3C-4427-887F-7A4FDC8F1C09-769x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/B64F0360-D4F3-4F92-9233-FAC1E6D4E885-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/F95A05A6-0822-4408-B20F-0CEEA1DAA25B-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Today was a short but important day. We had to get through a 4-mile section of construction on Route 50 that is only open on weekends to traffic. We also wanted to get closer to Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, but to go in one straight shot would have been a bit too much. So we booked a cabin halfway at Pleasant Valley, a little family business with cabins, an RV park and a restaurant (the only place to get food in the area).<\/p><p>There was some lovely scenery along the reservoir, including the Dillon Pinnacles which reminded us of the hoodoos of Bryce Canyon (which we&rsquo;ll pass through in a couple weeks).<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/E1E8DBC5-4988-4190-898F-BB50D3831807-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/99A4A7B8-79DB-4A1B-BD17-1CF7B16981D0-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/563E801F-6624-4792-B04E-9EAA09D2B25D-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>The construction was a little harrowing at times as there wasn&rsquo;t much shoulder and it alternated between paved and dirt, but it was a piece of cake compared to Marshall Pass. We had to pull over a few times to let the caravan pass. Mostly, cars were well-behaved.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/62BB94F3-6032-4572-BF5D-5CA154519FE8-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/4412BDD4-7B3D-4CB7-8904-243EF93D45DA-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/55135DD0-9E80-44EF-B2AE-E00908DDEA27-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We had a pretty long climb out of the canyon where the construction ended, but then it was one long, lovely downhill to Pleasant Valley.

Ed is a nearly-retired civil engineer from Louisville who is an avid bow hunter and was in the area primarily to hunt elk. Apparently the elk were being pretty shy so far on this trip. Ed goes all over the country for weeks at a time catching all sorts of game. He told us a particularly unfortunate story about how he had a freezer full of a year&rsquo;s worth of meat and came into the garage one day to find that the freezer had died and he lost <em>everything.<\/em> Weeks and weeks of collective work down the drain. On his way out he showed Tess how he makes calls to draw elk to him. We came away from the conversation with an entirely new view of hunting.<\/p><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.BE98A3FD-69F8-4F3B-B67F-A3F6BC035AA7.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><p>In fact, almost all of the guests were there on a hunting trip. This valley is to hunting as Tomichi Creek was to dirt biking. A bunch of hunters and a couple of vegetarians from New York. Everyone was really friendly to us, especially Cyndey and Tito, the owners and only two people running the whole joint. They&rsquo;re turning over cabins, getting groceries, making reservations, stocking the store and making everyone food. All the while, smiling and not breaking a sweat. They&rsquo;ve owned it for a decade and their experience shined. They made me a veggie burger with fries and Tess a breakfast sandwich. After we had a darn good slice of pecan pie. They have over ten varieties and make them all from scratch.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/DC97776F-9C52-4CF0-BAFE-8FB6BE4283EC-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/7FC62270-E54A-47B2-AE83-3164CBC2CB0B-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/870AB096-63D6-43D5-933B-1DAC00702347-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/DAEF65EC-1245-4AD8-A84F-718B23FCC14A-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We chilled outside the restaurant until our room was ready, then - you guessed it - showered and napped. We whiled away the rest of the afternoon relaxing on our little porch, doing laundry, and trip planning. Almost lost track of time and missed dinner, but snuck in before closing time. Tito was very chill as he churned out orders for a little rush that came in after us. We split a salad and veggie burger and Tess got a coconut cream pie slice to go. Tito popped over soon after we left to our cabin to get the heater started as it was getting pretty cold. We were half expecting him to tuck us in and give us glasses of warm milk. Tired, and gassy as hell from the delicious black bean burgers we&rsquo;d eaten all day, we drifted off to sleep. <\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/D72E8CFC-2E40-47DF-8D32-3BB41CA10AB0-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/14C14950-E18A-4386-9D8B-EF0E39BF929A-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/4C24F833-9B60-402E-AE99-19F5E6AD1025-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><\/p>","date":"September 14, 2022","fields":{"date":"09\/11\/2022","day_number":"65","multiple_days":false,"weather":"Sunny","locations":{"single":false,"start":"Blue Mesa Reservoir, CO","end":"Cimarron, CO"},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"27","elevation_gain":"3310","elevation_loss":"3812","flats":""}}}
