There was no one at the station, but there was a shady alcove with picnic tables, electrical outlets and clean bathrooms. We&rsquo;d found our post-up spot for the afternoon.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/4594A8C2-67A0-4C58-8665-5606BB5C8E3F-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/29301774-CE5D-4A56-97D1-8231905532DC-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/4E77C7C0-B1E0-4F9A-AD88-A99F6335C8D8-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Cars and RVs pulled into the station every once and a while, looking for camping (campground closed) or bathrooms.

Just then, a cyclist pulled into the station. He was doing a 600+ mile mixed surface bike race in a huge loop from Moab, and had just ridden from Monticello over the San Juan Mountains. He was just looking for water and a short rest before continuing on to the Henry Mountains. A very different experience from ours. A little later, four more cyclists in the race pulled in. Despite competing against each other, they were surprisingly chill. Just hanging out, excitedly discussing the route. They hung out for a while, and we gave them some energy chews before they set off again. One guy was all spent and had decided to call his girlfriend in Salt Lake to pick him up. We were glad we had no more riding to do that day.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/A6693C31-9456-48D0-AEBD-36FBDDD40ECF-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Finally, the sun disappeared behind the canyon wall and we relocated down to the well-kept but deserted campground. The road was blocked off to vehicles a ways up, so we knew we wouldn&rsquo;t be disturbed. We were in awe of our surroundings as the stars slowly came into view. As we lay in our tent, the only sound was the high-pitched squeaking of bats. We&rsquo;d hear them any time we woke up during the night until morning.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/2A015DE2-E0CA-4A03-8BE0-D3B1BC3C9F2D-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/D1055B34-86BE-462D-A2E8-F83BFFE717D4-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><\/p>","date":"September 27, 2022","fields":{"date":"09\/25\/2022","day_number":"79","multiple_days":false,"weather":"Beautiful and Hot","locations":{"single":false,"start":"Natural Bridges National Monument, UT","end":"Hite, UT"},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"50","elevation_gain":"1060","elevation_loss":"3776","flats":""}}}
