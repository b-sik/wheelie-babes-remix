{"ID":96,"title":"Day 2 &#8211; Lake Erie State Park, NY to Erie, PA","content":"<p>We woke up peacefully to the sounds of nature. Two chihuahuas barking madly, a grown man yelling at his children to get up &ldquo;before his wife starts bitchin&rdquo;&hellip;were we in the Garden of Eden?<p>We met Michelle before we set off, who was enthusiastic about our adventure and asked if we wanted some pictures taken.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/06AE2BE7-7F11-437C-82DC-F5EE768C4E17.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/5B842735-1CA6-4997-A131-33A87A105816.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We took a right out of the park and didn&rsquo;t make a single turn for the rest of the day. Luckily this stretch of Route 5 had a nice wide shoulder and beautiful scenery - rolling hills, endless vineyards, the ever-present Erie to our right.<\/p><p>We stopped at a hip little gas station for breakfast and coffee. Next door was the Barcelona Lighthouse, a small stone building that was the first lighthouse in the world to be lit by natural gas.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/2CF90216-B56F-4D03-B081-4733C6D1B264.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/45E4DC9D-042C-4706-A41A-B4349F708932.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/CD8DE95A-A2E8-4232-B403-0AD76331C3E2.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1DF6BCB0-58E2-4F5A-A1D1-A05D0338C42C.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/A5DD051D-FAAD-40FC-8C43-F7391C7F6FBF.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/4F537AB8-48FE-4119-BA0C-140C08C51279.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/B41D11B4-DE32-4F39-BCA6-7AE901189F31.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Later on we said goodbye to New York (until Grassroots Music Festival next week) and hello to Pennsylvania!

Tess took a little spill and took it like a champ. Our Warmshowers host Stephanie pointed us towards a brewery with good food to pass the time until she was home (Lavery Brewery). We had a couple of delicious veggie-filled wraps and homemade ginger ale (plus an IPA for Tess) and talked to a group of friends who were having a goodbye party for someone moving away. They gave us cupcakes!<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1DF392D4-236E-4D05-9575-FB0DD06D26CD.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/7A8C515B-98F1-4B9B-A1DD-F0A738E36CBD.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>When we got to Stephanie&rsquo;s place (a large urban farm), she was busy harvesting for next day&rsquo;s farmers market and preparing for a news feature the next morning but graciously took the time to make us feel at home. We set up our tent in the garden, showered and were provided with salad fixings from said garden. We helped out a little by planting some seeds for her. Another pair of bike tourists were also staying the night who had come from Oregon and were ending in Maine. Kind of like seeing us in the future! We fell asleep to firecrackers and car radios, which felt a little like home.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/6D8FC9FF-28D2-43D3-AA80-6E445C8988F7.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/5EB55175-0157-420B-8733-95143D50B0A2.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><\/p>","date":"July 11, 2022","fields":{"date":"07\/10\/2022","miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"39","elevation_gain":"325","elevation_loss":"282","flats":""},"day_number":"2","weather":"Gorgeous","locations":{"single":false,"start":"Lake Erie State Park, NY","end":"Erie, PA"}}}
