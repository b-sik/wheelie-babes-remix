We decided on low premium\/high deductible because we enjoy gambling with our well-being!<p>As we were about to head out on our bikes a thunderstorm was rolling through town so we waited a bit longer. Fortunately our Airbnb was a nice place to wait.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/182442F9-FC2E-4EF9-A9C2-A318AC5FD29B-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/F830B437-4A61-433E-B441-80F1C1E11E3E-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>When we finally left it was lunchtime so we stopped at Wiltshire Pantry Bakery and Caf&eacute; nearby our Airbnb. We sat in the shade outside and split an apple soda that looked interesting and had some delicious meals. Our bodies were craving fresh greens and were satisfied. I had a no-bake cookie with probably the most lopsided ratio of yummy-looking to yummy-tasting&hellip;wasn&rsquo;t sure about the recommendation from the bakery employee but it blew my taste buds away.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/C4387CA5-FBCE-4F3F-A89F-60E78BFA1C86-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>From there we headed to the Kentucky Derby museum via Old Louisville.

It was getting into the 90s at this point so we were pumped to get into the air-conditioned Kentucky Derby Museum. The experience started out with a 360 degree movie about the Derby&rsquo;s history, followed by a guided tour of the track and grandstand. I was proud to answer a question that stumped the other tour-goers (name the two most recent Triple Crown winners), and walked the rest of the tour with a bit of a swagger. Stable maids fainted as I passed by.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/48701A64-2FCC-4FE0-9723-11CFCA899FFA-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/DA8C8764-41D9-4443-BCFA-4EFAF22A2F78-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/808FDD87-A761-4C36-8782-FF0EB8824489-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Derby dirt<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/BC4BE8F2-0F6E-4C47-A4CB-26E509AA63BC-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.87982E2E-3784-4C55-8433-CC927D72ABFC.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><p><br>We finished up by walking through the museum.

When we got back I started getting stuff packed away to make the next morning easier, then we took a quick nap. <\/p><p>Since this was our last night in a legit city until San Francisco, we made sure to enjoy a nice restaurant experience. We went to Pizza Lupo, voted best pizza in Louisville and not too far from our place. We dug the vibe, and really dug their special Fiore pie - crust stuffed with ricotta, with arugula and burrata. There were no leftovers.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/91ED3184-B8F1-413C-950A-64B87DAE41C3-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/899D31A6-0F06-4B11-98FC-17B42ED4476D-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Since we were in Louisville, we&rsquo;d be remiss if we didn&rsquo;t try some bourbon. We took a Lyft across Louisville driven by a local with a lot of enthusiasm for telling us all about his city. Shopbar is a cool, chill bar that has a vintage shop in it (this was closed when we were there). We had a superb little bourbon Old Fashioned there and had fun people watching.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/828D9FF4-319C-4ECA-ABBA-6AAA1036818B-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/4445BB13-A298-4E88-8E6B-D3418A4A4837-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We walked home and finished packing everything up and Tess coerced me into a steam shower, which I didn&rsquo;t love.
