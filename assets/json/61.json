{"ID":1460,"title":"Day 61 &#8211;  Wetmore, CO to Westcliffe, CO","content":"<p>We had some butterflies in our stomach in anticipation of our first big climb of the Rockies, but felt inspired by watching the long climbs of Tour de Spain cyclists the night before. Kristin made us &rdquo;Hot Latin Lover&rdquo; coffee with cinnamon and cayenne pepper, and we scarfed down big bowls of cereal. Johnny bade us adieu around 7am and headed out on his 12 mile bike commute to work.<figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1B6AA146-4398-45BD-AD20-40158109A8F3-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>When we could putter around no longer, we packed up, inflated Tess&rsquo; flat front tire, and set off with Kristin, who would ride up the mountain with us until she felt like heading back down. We&rsquo;d been warned about a super steep section on S-curves a little ways in, so we were wondering how we&rsquo;d fare on them.  Kristin, who had no baggage, was sweet enough to go at our pace. Right before the steep section she said goodbye and headed back to start her work day.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/94CB2505-78B0-4323-B429-F7AD3AAF688D-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/FCC9D95F-DBB2-47B3-BA8C-2829A0E3EF6D-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/D159E487-2670-4E2F-B715-24227BD5B6D4-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Pretty soon we were in our lowest gear and grinding through the tough grade. It was difficult, but preferable to the steep roller coaster riding of Missouri. You could almost zone out on this road. Tess&rsquo; hamstrings were getting pretty sore after a while, but she kept trucking.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/55D0C4BD-B6CD-4841-B399-629558B64020-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.35746193-A524-4B1C-B7E1-0EBCB041FFE9.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><p>And then it started to flatten out, and we couldn&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;d already gotten through the tough stretch. In less than 10 miles we&rsquo;d gained 2,500 feet. We were still going up for a while after that, but it felt like flat road. This was a big confidence booster, as this grade exceeded what we&rsquo;d expect crossing the Continental Divide in a few days.<\/p><p>Around the point where we reached the top of Hardscrabble Pass, my stomach started to feel really uncomfortable. I couldn&rsquo;t tell if it was a buildup of gas, or worse that I had strained something from pushing so hard. At one point we needed to stop so I could lie down for a second. Was I having trouble with the altitude?<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/BEAD963A-0952-45D3-A5A4-709F207E5904-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>The payoff for our climb opened up in front of us - a huge row of massive peaks across Wet Mountain Valley. We started a long descent that would take us all the way to Westcliffe. I had my camera out a lot in this stretch.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/44108C21-87FF-44FC-894C-322459EC4294-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.93CD3B93-6D90-4206-AB57-74D96967F9A4.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.6A9EFF83-1F3F-4A18-961D-E987A36E43FA.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure it was a gas issue - I expelled quite a bit on the descent and after a visit to the water closet at Tony&rsquo;s Mountain Pizza, I felt much better. I Googled whether it might have had something to do with the altitude&hellip;apparently there&rsquo;s something called High Altitude Flatus Expulsion (HAFE). Or maybe I just ate something that disagreed with me. I digress.<\/p><p>We purposely got way more food than we needed so we could save some for dinner -  salad, a big pizza and a pasta. It was delicious.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/2526ED90-63A9-4ABB-9DE5-06A090F70A0F-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1A2DDD07-4A44-49AD-9393-8956EBE62233-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>After lunch we headed down the hill to Antler Liquor Store and Motel to get a room. They were the cheapest place in town and the rooms actually were quite nice. The owners let us put our leftovers in the walk-in beer fridge. We showered and napped and continued catching up on writing our posts. Tess went for a little walk to get ice cream at Sugarlump before they closed.<\/p><p>We headed out in the early evening and walked down the really cute main drag to Bootleggers Bistro for a drink. We struck up a conversation with a man sitting alone next to us who lived his whole life in Wet Mountain Valley. He&rsquo;d lost his son in active duty several years ago, and mentioned that a section of highway in Hardscrabble Pass was dedicated to him. I remembered the sign and the name - Ranger Chris Horn. It was a really sad story and you could tell how proud of him he is to this day.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/6FD731E3-FF94-4D0E-B596-165E7D612C98-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/EF9CFE42-31B5-4556-960B-17060A0673FC-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1B03EFAC-74A1-41F5-A5AD-DF5BDC6B63CA-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Getting hungry again, we went back to the motel and finished our pizza at a table outside.
