{"ID":1011,"title":"Day 40 &#8211; Eminence, MO to Houston, MO","content":"<p>Breakfast is served at Hawkins House between 8 and 9, so naturally we did away with our usual crack-of-dawn departure. They made us special vegetarian breakfasts - biscuits and non-meat gravy with scrambled eggs with veggies and cheese. We chatted with some of the other guests as we were leaving, one of whom had biked throughout Europe in her youth with homemade panniers and sleeping bag.<p>We hit a couple monster hills in the first five miles, which brought us to Alley Spring. It&rsquo;s Missouri&rsquo;s seventh largest spring, with 81 million gallons of water flowing through it daily. There&rsquo;s a big old red mill house next to it, and it was extremely picturesque. The water was unbelievably clear - we wanted to jump in and gulp it down.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/20BAC191-5F0E-42F0-9349-E312E9CCB21B-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/F85A5620-E76A-4186-AB7C-EA1DD496E020-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/7FC85345-4D45-46E2-B580-1AFDA77F07FC-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/EA61A676-FC7E-41FD-8F06-4F20794827F1-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/5023E387-3A41-4C24-842D-597D7FBA84D9-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/24A04826-E62B-447F-8D2F-B8AD56D98CD9-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.DA4719A3-8EE3-4D1D-B7B5-5DB189E5A6D8.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.E72DB3F2-6A97-4CDC-8F1B-A7A5DCC94F47.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><p>After the initial big hills, it was dips and thickets for the rest of the day. Except for one section with a bunch of trucks, traffic was very light. The air was cool with no humidity.

We were welcomed with open arms by the owner Cindy, who quickly became part of our trail family. Tea and bagels were on the house. We chatted with her and her daughter Gianna for a while, and she told everyone who came in that we were biking across the country. In this manner we met Marylyn, who works at the hospital cafeteria and told us to come the next morning for a free breakfast. When we headed out to explore, Cindy insisted we leave our bikes at the shop so we could travel light.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/3FA608E9-AEF2-4088-805E-1CBDD12FF632-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We scoped out the park where we&rsquo;d be pitching our tent that night, which was really nice - splash pad, tennis courts, pool, and bathrooms with showers, all immaculate. The pool seemed to be closed, which was a bit of a bummer. Then we wandered over to Lilia&rsquo;s Taqueria for an early dinner. We talked to Lilia - originally from Mexico City and very sweet - in Spanish for a while (Tess more than I). We split a burrito that blew any other Mexican food we&rsquo;d had on the trip so far out of the water.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/44E1E9E0-BB7F-4871-85F8-2663680E5AB2-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/ADE402C8-F3ED-42A9-B60B-25CA96ACEB80-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1F90E49A-DDFB-4B04-87AA-14F1D3134240-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>When we returned to Mean Muggin, Cindy had arranged showers for us elsewhere in the building (the landlord&rsquo;s office shower). She also gave us some Ritz crackers and filled up our water bottles. Gianna brought over their super cute dog Meatball, and we all got a photo together. We arranged to stop by in the morning for some coffee and meet her friend, thanked her profusely, and headed to the park to set up camp. By that point we were getting pretty tired.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/8A80A6DE-A042-4F71-99DF-BD1CAF23D283-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>The tranquil park we&rsquo;d left earlier was now bumping - the pool was open and packed, 90s music was blaring and a doubles match was happening on the tennis court next door.

Not long after, another bike tourist pulled into the park - the first time we had a fellow cyclist sleeping pal! Ian started in Oregon and was heading east on the Transamerica. He&rsquo;s from outside Boulder currently but has lived all over. We shared stories and tips on what to check out down the trail. His tips on the best upcoming bakeries were particularly useful. <\/p><p>It was comforting knowing there was a cyclist comrade sleeping nearby. After good nights, I donned my earplugs and sleeping mask and slept soundly.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/8929F320-98A2-4665-82A9-B77ED81BE918-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><\/p>","date":"August 19, 2022","fields":{"date":"08\/17\/2022","day_number":"40","multiple_days":false,"weather":"Magnificent","locations":{"single":false,"start":"Eminence, MO","end":"Houston, MO"},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"43","elevation_gain":"1844","elevation_loss":"1339","flats":""}}}
