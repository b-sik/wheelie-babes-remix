We had a short day ahead so we weren&rsquo;t in any rush. On her way out of the parking lot Tess took a spill and got a boo boo on her knee.<figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/A9D0B7EE-480C-407F-9E8A-64D1D56D00ED-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We headed south on Route 191 and had some pretty decent hills towards the beginning.

A mile or so out of town was Yak&rsquo;s Cafe, which didn&rsquo;t look like much from the outside, but had some delicious food. I got a breakfast burrito filled with egg, cheese, hash browns, a black bean veggie patty, and covered in homemade green chili sauce! At the table next to us there were a couple of old Native American customers that were struggling a bit with their breakfast. The man asked the waitress if she could cut his pancakes because he was paralyzed on his left side. Tess helped out when they accidentally dropped one of their coffee mugs. We felt bad for them.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/9CF19710-2DDC-48FF-9829-32692B520AC8-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/DBCC6E2F-854E-4E4E-BA82-700F36FDB967-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Tess wanted to go to the Dinosaur Museum, but it looked like it was geared towards kids so we compromised by going to Edge of the Cedars State Park. It houses one the largest collection of American Southwest artifacts. There were a&nbsp;<em>lot&nbsp;<\/em>of clay pots. Outside there was an ancient Pueblo ruin with a kiva (underground gathering space) that you could go down into. Tess was a little spooked about going into a dark hole, so I led the way. I passed gas in the kiva, which Tess thought might be bad luck.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/66FC9484-1952-447C-9662-406B3746795B-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/B23077F9-FA0E-4269-812C-05BDE0092667-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/628F94DD-A670-4950-AA5D-F8FBD6F7D4A6-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/735A6E20-87D9-4FDB-BDAD-A7B321AC438F-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/4BF1D334-C164-446A-9AB0-DC99A3F99C50-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/66420E6E-40DB-4157-91C2-390C2A18675F-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/2182AF1C-E889-4D36-A5AA-A049F3D34ED8-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.5C0A7EB2-2F03-4434-A278-91D570E19C6F.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><p><br>Down the path was a sculpture that functioned as a calendar; lines of light would illuminate different drawings on the solstices.
