{"ID":561,"title":"Day 21 &#8211; Cincinnati, OH to Rising Sun, IN","content":"<p>Today we visited three states - Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky - a feat that I don&rsquo;t expect will be repeated on this trip.<p>We woke up with Mark and saw him off again, thanking him profusely. At some point or another during our stay, he offered us just about everything he owned. This is part of a pattern of generosity I&rsquo;m starting to notice from Warmshowers hosts.<\/p><p>Today we put our fates in the hands of the Google gods to deliver us to our destination in Rising Sun, Indiana. We were looking for a good shortcut to get back to the Underground Railroad trail at Madison, Indiana; at Cincinnati, it takes a long deviation to the southeast that we didn&rsquo;t feel the need to follow. I&rsquo;d say Google did a pretty nifty job overall.<\/p><p>On our way to coffee we rode out to the middle of the large Purple People bridge, which has been fully converted to pedestrian-only. It was at this point we made our first, but not last, crossing to Kentucky.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/A282F6BE-4E0B-4BD2-8DC5-89A71B3057D9-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/2DA83947-9C5B-4AE3-BEDA-A65E3F318034-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/24E1FD9D-DEF0-4E16-B08B-E41E6ECD3A19-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Our coffee stop was Kidd Coffee, which was a stand in the lobby of an office building. The receptionist informed us that &ldquo;that coffee stand has been closed for four years&rdquo;, which we got a kick out of. Instead we found another Deeper Roots location not far away which we preferred anyway. Cardamom morning bun, spinach feta croissant, and cold brew followed. As we left, a hipster cyclist in over-the-top gear at the next table (who had thus far ignored us and our laden bikes), lazily informed us he felt &ldquo;it was his duty&rdquo; to ask us about our trip. I felt it was my duty to ask why he was a prick, but refrained from saying so.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/3B0D9692-42F9-40CA-889D-A697D759CD64-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>For a long way at the beginning of our ride we followed Hillside Avenue which sat above the busy road along the river and was nice and carless. At this point Tess found out that her gear situation had worsened since it was looked at in Cincy. We brainstormed how we could get it looked at while we were in Louisville, but unfortunately we&rsquo;d be there Sunday and Monday, two of the worst days for bike shops to be open.&nbsp;<\/p><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.33E4A504-0419-4CCA-AA33-51F37ECE6B51.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/206F52E3-8C4F-44FB-A4A3-68CC667422C4-769x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We had flat roads and good shoulders until we approached Lawrenceburg, when the shoulders disappeared and the traffic level doubled (and we entered Indiana!). Around this time we were drawn to the Buckeye Trading Post by the plethora of stone statues on the front lawn. We met the owner Shannon, who took a picture of us in front of a big Buffalo statue. Apparently some Vietnamese hackers took over her Facebook, so she asked us to tag her on Instagram instead. In a back room she had a little museum filled with Native American and other local historical artifacts.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/F4506DF7-3620-4675-A185-1DAF3CD73DA3-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/3130A181-DA3B-464D-A91A-49764C494938-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/69C65F-9231-4941-9994-F7E3E9BCABD6-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/CD30DB3F-4C8D-445B-A409-C12DB5333C78-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We breathed a sigh of relief when we turned off into the village, where we took a coffee and blog break at Funny Farm Coffee.

They both have lived in the area most of their lives, but recently moved from Lawrenceburg to a location where they have a bit more peace and quiet.

We were shown to our sleeping digs - the whole top floor and a room overlooking the Ohio!<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/71AD3B3C-7FC5-4196-9C27-C172C7D0339A-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>When we&rsquo;d looked at our route in the days leading up to this one, we thought it was pretty funny that there was a town across from Rising Sun in Kentucky called &rdquo;Rabbit Hash&rdquo;.

We wanted nothing more in the world, we said!<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/812DE7-C364-4189-9438-BCB5347F7591-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/ED6B6ED0-7694-4E30-8E86-F874AA353ACC-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/E8359BA5-0595-4EAD-871E-67C19DA05858-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/27DF59DF-FC78-4BCA-90F4-4878C7205904-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Rabbit Hash is not much except for a little collection of buildings on the edge of the river, anchored by the famous general store. The place immediately struck a chord with us - old-timey but not kitschy, natural but not crunchy, we felt we were transported into a little wonderland. We had to stop ourselves from buying everything we saw (financial and baggage limitations), but settled for a cap (me) and a t-shirt (Tess). We also got a couple obligatory Sarsaparillas which were quite refreshing.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/F10E02EB-0A0E-41BE-9DB2-D59335A7F1EF-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/BBCB6107-E497-4779-9E58-C23107BDFDAC-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/3262AB87-78C4-4E8D-AA00-B64A7F24230B-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/6DCAD753-913B-4BDE-8470-4AD63B89D27E-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/72185FEE-DF5B-4DA4-856D-398F25FA140A-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/F53C871F-EE5E-4DAA-8AD6-DA5125D7AE5E-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/39D4A457-7180-467E-A152-90C2532FB678-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/28D6C2E7-4A8C-4A5A-95E6-DBD3D4F43D04-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>After Rabbit Hash, we had a delicious vegetarian casserole with veggies and quinoa made by Diane.
