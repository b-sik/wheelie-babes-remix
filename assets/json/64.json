{"ID":1576,"title":"Day 64 &#8211;  Sargents, CO to Blue Mesa Reservoir, CO","content":"<p>We were greeted with high-30s temperatures when we awoke at Tomichi Creek Trading Post, just a week after near-100s in Pueblo. Colorado has proven to be extreme, which has in turn pushed us to our extremes, physically and emotionally. It was the first true test of our 25 degree rated sleeping bag, and it passed with flying colors. We lingered longer than necessary because it was so toasty.<figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/D108F5D0-5E4D-404E-9BDC-896C987D3B13-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/3FAD40-CF20-4778-B3CD-2127E442FB4F-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Eventually we put on our warm clothes and walked next door to the restaurant for breakfast. Pretty sweet setup. There was a lot of Saturday morning activity - dirt bikers, farmers, and truckers stopping for a bite and a cuppa Joe. We each got French toast with a side of eggs and hash browns. By the way, I ditched the no coffee plan but have mostly stuck to just the morning.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/BF6C6E12-1155-4962-BFB5-609DBB640360-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Tess and the ketchup man from the night before (Dirk) got on the same page during breakfast. We also talked for a bit with some nice mountain bikers (Meric, Stephanie and I think Brian?), who gave us one of their bear sprays. We don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll need it, but accepted it just in case. They demonstrated proper use of the bear spray for us too.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/917A7CFB-7607-48A3-984E-7F2ADAC23474-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>After we geared up and hit the pavement it was almost 10am. Speaking of pavement, it was so smooth we were nearly weeping. We flipped off the Marshall Pass Road sign as we peeled away from the Trading Post. I&rsquo;d lost my sunglasses somewhere in the complex, most likely while I was in a stupor from crossing the pass. I&rsquo;d also called the bike shop in Salida to ensure no one else was given the same advice.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/53DF27CB-08CA-4C4B-A94B-D43CF58F355F-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>It was mostly downhill to Gunnison where we planned to stop for lunch and groceries. We flew through the first ten miles, and the mountain air was cool.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/7A6854-9C89-47C4-ACD5-27610CA57E43-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/D3EB54FE-911B-4CE9-84BE-B20520848F6B-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/26BA04B2-BBE6-4509-8E0A-10D4E0DB899F-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/5B6F293C-8DD2-4121-BA65-2B2E935044C9-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Then, about 15 miles from Gunnison a headwind the likes of which we had not yet encountered came out of nowhere. We were getting buffeted around like crazy as it whipped through the valley. It was bad timing having just lost my sunglasses; my eyes were dry and bloodshot in no time. Needless to say we were pretty wiped out by the time we arrived in town.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/9188EF4D-ACFC-4CD6-9499-D3C4A5179A12-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/86C70327-EF7E-4BB0-8315-BE01732663DB-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/B9821620-B0D7-4C55-BAAB-B29AE872BFBC-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/5C754EE1-8697-46EF-8DFB-105B7A1E2015-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Gunnison is a cute college town, home of Western Colorado University. We sat out back at the Back Country Cafe, which appeared to be Gunnison&rsquo;s version of Geneseo Family Restaurant, our college town&rsquo;s cheap breakfast and lunch spot. None of the staff seemed to be older than 23, and the whole back patio was filled with a group of twenty or so college girls getting their Saturday morning pick-me-up. Our food was so-so, particularly our $5 &rdquo;seasonal fresh fruit bowl&rdquo; served in a dish 1 inch high and 4 inches wide, containing:<\/p><ul><li>1 strawberry, sliced<\/li><li>2 thin slices of watermelon<\/li><li>5 grapes<\/li><li>4 blueberries<\/li><\/ul><p>After our massive vitamin boost we wandered to Tomichi Cycles where I got a new pair of sunglasses - a bit more expensive than my last, as their selection was limited. What a difference the extra cost made though&hellip;nice polarization, and the colors look so much more vibrant. I call them my &rdquo;happy glasses&rdquo; as they instantly improve my mood.<\/p><p>Our last stop was the grocery store to load up for dinner and breakfast at the campsite, then back on the road into the fierce headwind. Tomichi Creek, which we&rsquo;d been following the whole day, fittingly ran into the Gunnison River in the town of Gunnison. As we rode, the sides of the valley became sharper and the river wider. Eventually Blue Mesa Reservoir, Colorado&rsquo;s largest body of water, came into view. The water level was clearly a lot lower than usual.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/ABB0B69A-BFEB-4712-B60C-B773D613833F-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/357851B9-77E0-477D-8F51-47040F4D9CD9-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.E81B2A1A-FD43-41C4-AAFF-9E93EBB15127.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><p>Tess hit a wall as we rounded the reservoir, especially after a series of climbs, so the last few miles were a bit of a struggle. To make things worse, in the opposite lane a long line of vehicles had built up behind a slow RV, and one pickup truck way at the back decided to make a break for it. It was going over 80 mph in our lane coming in our direction but Tess&rsquo; head was down against the wind so she didn&rsquo;t see it coming. She was so startled when it shot by us a couple feet away that we had to pull over because she was hyperventilating. <\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/A26F1195-FE57-41CC-9B0B-C005150FAE89-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Then, in the turning lane to go into Elk Creek Campground, a woman in an SUV screamed at us. We yelled back, making obscene hand gestures. As we pedaled to our site, we talked about the gruesome fate we hoped she would soon meet, aside from clearly being a miserable person. Drivers in Colorado have been the most aggressive so far, something I would not have guessed.<\/p><p>Our anger soon dissipated as we got to our beautiful campsite by the water. It was around 4pm and still hot, so we took advantage and went for a dip, followed by some lounging in the sand, eating chips and dried mango.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/70DDE4C5-37AC-4200-AA2C-F1E6AF29A8F7-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/F7FDC8EB-BB6C-4A20-8773-17CDBF5C0F5E-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/4A9F0F-CC68-45D8-A154-5BB5BD6EF539-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/4A5F9AB6-1084-4E83-AAA4-A39422690182-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>For dinner we had PB, Nutella and granola wraps, a concoction we&rsquo;ve had enough by now that we&rsquo;ve named them &rdquo;country nut rolls&rdquo;. The sunset over the reservoir was picturesque, and as it got darker the wind slowed to a breeze. Then thousands of big fly-like insects came out so we retired to the tent. We dozed off to the fluttering sound of the bugs flapping against the rain fly, comforted they couldn&rsquo;t get in.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/7BD6610D-A140-42FE-8FAC-5AC3473006A0-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/19DA72CE-C891-441C-BBF0-4A6689D38CD7-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/BD47D0DA-1975-4AC0-AEF8-FFD6AC5E05B3-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/C786F1BD-D89D-400D-9679-DF1240832936-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/61993CF3-5E45-4FAD-B1CF-A639A5C91B80-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><\/p>","date":"September 13, 2022","fields":{"date":"09\/10\/2022","day_number":"64","multiple_days":false,"weather":"Sunny, Windy","locations":{"single":false,"start":"Sargents, CO","end":"Blue Mesa Reservoir, CO"},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"48","elevation_gain":"1430","elevation_loss":"2280","flats":""}}}
