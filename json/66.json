{"ID":1642,"title":"Day 66 &#8211; Cimarron, CO to Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, CO","content":"<p>Tess started the morning by installing her patched front tube. When we left Blue Mesa we&rsquo;d noticed it was flat again! So we searched the tire inside and out for any foreign objects that might be causing the slow leak. I removed a sharp little pebble, which was all I could find&hellip;we patched it and hoped that was the last of it.<figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/FEB82316-D4AA-4351-962C-F0B9112997D5-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We made some oatmeal and coffee at the cabin for breakfast, and watched the resident sheep through the window. Tess went down to the store and asked Tito and Cydney to make us some sandwiches for the road, since there would be nothing between there and the park.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/9EDB89C1-A731-4149-8ADE-3D26CA850AAC-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>It was a shortish day ahead with two big climbs. The first was on route so we knew the elevation profile from the Adventure Cycling app, and we got a general sense of the second climb into the park from Google. We were originally going to try to find a mode of transport into the park from the nearby city of Montrose, but couldn&rsquo;t find anything so we decided to bike the six or so miles up instead.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/8170AAFC-1C23-435F-B4E1-348356173033-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>The first climb out of the valley to Cerro Summit was long but not too strenuous. Traffic was pretty bad though, and we passed through a tight area of construction. Then it was a long down to Route 347 which took us north into the park.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/0D2A4E67-FC51-4E92-8E53-73872024AED2-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>To quote one of our Warmshowers hosts, anything can be accomplished with enough confidence and ignorance. If we&rsquo;d known quite how steep this slope was ahead of time, we probably would have passed on visiting the park.  Instead, we just kept pedaling up the seemingly never-ending mountain. Car drivers were looking out their windows at us looking impressed or confused. It was really only when we looked back that we realized how high up we were going. At one pit stop, we heard a loud bang as Tess&rsquo; front tube burst. We think the tube was pinched by the tire as it was installed, and maybe over-inflated. We were thankful it didn&rsquo;t happen on the steep downhill we&rsquo;d just been on. After replacing the tube, we pushed on. Up goes the flat counter.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/9CCB7D7F-3BF8-43D5-AE2F-0CFD35C70CAA-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Finally we entered the park! We stopped to get a picture at the sign and proceeded to be passed by a caravan of almost a hundred motorcyclists. We started waving, and then they kept coming and we kept waving and laughing. Then we had to wait behind them in the long line that had formed to enter the park.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/BEF0EE2E-290E-44F5-8E73-106AA261A93E-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We got to our campsite, which had been the last one available to choose online, and settled in. There wasn&rsquo;t much shade but we sat in the shade of a bush and ate our sandwiches and chips we&rsquo;d dreamt about the whole ride up. We set up the tent and tried to take a nap but it was too hot, so we decided to go out exploring by bike instead. Our neighbor Lisa who was there by herself for her birthday weekend, gave us some ice for our coffee we&rsquo;d brought. We biked along the 7-mile Rim Road stopping at all the viewpoints along the way. Each one was more gorgeous than the last.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/AEFF8495-2831-4015-B5F1-68941F4BAE51-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/B7490B3E-7A5D-4FCD-A5A8-E02DD76E6129-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/313A8BB4-12D8-454A-AD0D-218AB22843D6-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/DCBB8B20-65F8-4D34-B44F-9EF0E43E5DDD-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/FCA6B9FB-118D-4F23-A6EA-9FCAE927472F-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We&rsquo;re amazed that this park isn&rsquo;t more well known. The one limitation is that there aren&rsquo;t many hikes, and the most accessible way to see the park is to drive Rim Road like we were doing. There are three steep hikes down into the canyon, and they all require permits.<\/p><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.89D8AB99-F63F-4427-8E35-FEDA325F4114.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><p>We were particularly smitten by Chasm View and Painted Wall View.

We got back to camp, made some country nut rolls, took a stroll around the campground and went to bed early. Definitely worth the work it took to get there!<\/p><\/p>","date":"September 15, 2022","fields":{"date":"09\/12\/2022","day_number":"66","multiple_days":false,"weather":"Sunny","locations":{"single":false,"start":"Cimarron, CO","end":"Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, CO"},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"21","elevation_gain":"2851","elevation_loss":"1575","flats":"1"}}}
