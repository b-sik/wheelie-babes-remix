{"ID":1101,"title":"Day 44 &#8211; Golden City, MO to Pittsburg, KS","content":"<p>As our eyes opened, we had one word in our heads: Cooky&rsquo;s. We wasted no time throwing our stuff on our bikes and pedaling over, lines of drool trailing behind. We did actually stop for a picture of a really nicely-lit water tower.<figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/55A12FD4-E02A-4F12-A98F-7B5DCB934F96-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/20A5B34D-D80F-49B0-A6AC-23B7C0C29D63-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We agreed that our bodies couldn&rsquo;t afford to consume any more pie, so we walked straight past the pie display, eyes forward. Instead, we got omelettes with the fluffiest, butteriest biscuit we&rsquo;d ever tasted. That and a couple cups of coffee was the nectar of the gods.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/17D8A53E-EF63-4635-ADB2-57A3182CC3F1-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>A local man chatted with us about the need for more bike infrastructure in the area, noting that a lot of people are against any sort of change. It was a refreshing perspective to hear. He also asked us if we knew the state tree of Kansas. We said we didn&rsquo;t. &rdquo;Telephone pole,&rdquo; he muttered with a small smile.<\/p><p>On our way out, we insisted we were actually leaving this time for good, glanced once more at all the pies, and walked out. We weren&rsquo;t too sad though, as our first stop in Pittsburg was another old cafe that was supposed to have bomb cinnamon rolls.<\/p><p>We had another shorter day today, made even shorter by the nice tailwind we had the whole way to Pittsburg. Route 126 took us door-to-door with no turns. As it has been lately, the weather was nice and sunny and not too hot. There were a lot of wind turbines along the way which were cool to see. How anyone thinks of them as an eyesore is beyond me.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/563C535F-3D7F-49A6-B65A-81F67048F5A1-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/4C4FD382-F030-4C29-8446-D25B630B21E9-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/38FA4C9E-FE5B-4D7E-AB7C-D56FEF63CBCC-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/0692798F-16BF-44F3-B26E-A205F0FA3C6B-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/57BC3236-08C4-4C3B-BDA8-B10E3A66EC19-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Tess, Go Girl pro<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/figure><p>It&rsquo;s amazing how little energy is expended thinking about car traffic on these straight flat roads compared to the roads we&rsquo;d been on so far. With unimpaired sight lines, you can just hug the shoulder and cars will take their time passing you. We can ride side by side now for the most part too.<\/p><p>Hello Kansas! We crossed the border five miles from Pittsburg. It&rsquo;s the eighth state of our trip! We couldn&rsquo;t believe we were already through Missouri. After all the nerves about it, we quite enjoyed it.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/72A57201-410A-4746-9AD6-57B1E4E2FA56-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We made it into Pittsburg by 11 and headed straight to Harry&rsquo;s. We noticed there was a coffee shop next door that looked to have better coffee, so we got cinnamon buns to go and brought them over (surreptitiously of course). The coffee was indeed good, and the cinnamon buns were the best we&rsquo;d ever had. We made ourselves comfortable and sat there for quite a while.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/8775B5F5-556D-4BFC-ABCC-0AA92BDF906C-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/AD80F4AA-3AA3-476F-B13A-9BC8C8321759-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/066F3EB4-CB77-43EE-89C0-B493A75FC2F2-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Downtown Pittsburg had the feel of a once depressed town experiencing a rebirth. It looked like the streetscape had just been improved and there were a lot of new-looking shops and restaurants. It&rsquo;s the home of Pittsburg State University, and we saw a lot of students getting ready to start the semester.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/FCD6D284-26AD-4833-B51A-A121CAA67785-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We headed south on Broadway towards our hotel. We&rsquo;d booked this a while in advance as something to look forward to, and because we&rsquo;d really been craving going to the movies and there was an AMC across the street. After showers and naps we traversed parking lot hell to go see Top Gun: Maverick. We were pretty into it, though I was a little distracted by the constipation I&rsquo;d developed over the past couple days. I wonder what caused it. It couldn&rsquo;t be because I&rsquo;ve been exclusively eating baked goods.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/66018006-700C-451F-B5C0-1F91BEB9E712-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Afterwards we loaded up at the Ron&rsquo;s Supermarket salad bar and got some fruit and kombuchas. We needed a nutrient infusion. Back at the hotel we feasted and watched Beverly Hills Cop on TV. Peak Eddie Murphy. I decided I&rsquo;m going to make myself some Axel Foley sweatshirt cutoffs when the trip&rsquo;s over.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/5B6C2A00-01FC-4338-9E8A-CCCF74964F15.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><\/p>","date":"August 23, 2022","fields":{"date":"08\/21\/2022","day_number":"44","multiple_days":false,"weather":"Sunny","locations":{"single":false,"start":"Golden City, MO","end":"Pittsburg, KS"},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"36","elevation_gain":"95","elevation_loss":"256","flats":""}}}
