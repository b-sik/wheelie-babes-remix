{"ID":2504,"title":"Day 94 &#8211; Illipah Reservoir, NV to Eureka, NV","content":"<p>I think scientists would agree it was &ldquo;cold as balls&rdquo; when our alarm went off. We scurried out to briefly look at the sunrise and grab our breakfast before we dove back into the sleeping bag. We didn&rsquo;t feel warm enough to get moving until about 9am, and then it started to warm up quickly.<figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/95A0BB0D-A25D-4E89-9E8F-0A8B30EA844F-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/9DE0D59B-65FC-4AEF-88A6-A1DB061E6D20-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>It was a little over 40 miles to Eureka with two mountain passes. By this point in Nevada it was starting to feel pretty routine. Mid-morning, after Tess and I had been riding in silence side-by-side for a while, I let out a loud coyote howl and almost gave her a heart attack. I realize now I shouldn&rsquo;t have done that.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/60E6F586-76FC-49CF-9B45-E1DB6DE0A9B0-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/99C0A85C-83FB-4B4B-9360-BD987AA840DF-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/5F458EBF-4D5E-4407-8EB4-9F81DEC92A32-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/0000E3AE-8500-4EEB-9A9A-487675F80627-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We had the realization that we&rsquo;d be in San Francisco in less than two weeks! That really messed with our heads. We&rsquo;d been operating one day at a time for so long, and now it was time to think about the &rdquo;after times&rdquo;. <\/p><p>We arrived in Eureka in time for some late lunch at Clementine&rsquo;s. We each ordered a large veggie sub, planning to take half for dinner. These things were massive! They make their own sub rolls here, and they let those things get huge. Quite delicious indeed. The coffee, not so much.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/0CBB032C-D8C2-481F-AD8B-9DAB29D309C8-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/B57138B1-2E6D-40F3-AB41-3FE79C07F464-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Eureka was a mostly run down but quaint old western town. We were staying at the Eureka Gold Country Inn down the street, and there we got the shower\/nap combo out of the way. The latter part was initially tough as they were doing construction in the hall. One call to the front desk, however, and they paused. Nap commence!<\/p><p>When we woke up we went for a stroll around town, which didn&rsquo;t take all that long. Two tourists were getting a ghost tour from a woman dolled up in fancy old Western garb. We stopped at the Owl Club Bar for a drink at sat outside. &rsquo;Twas a lovely evening for a wee sit. Afterwards we went back to the hotel for a rendez-vous with our subs, and settled in for the night.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/EC5A3500-E9A7-48F1-BC3A-58EB18BD8688.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/56D3B3FB-71CB-4AB0-8F80-377CB1C60DFB.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1E5701C7-ACA8-48B3-8FD3-918100CA11E8.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/655BE421-94C0-4CC0-A145-D56E43129129-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><\/p>","date":"October 16, 2022","fields":{"date":"10\/10\/2022","day_number":"94","multiple_days":false,"weather":"Brillig","locations":{"single":false,"start":"Illipah Reservoir, NV","end":"Eureka, NV"},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"42","elevation_gain":"2513","elevation_loss":"2825","flats":""}}}
