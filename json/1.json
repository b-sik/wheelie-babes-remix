{"ID":73,"title":"Day 1 &#8211; East Aurora, NY to Lake Erie State Park, NY","content":"<h2>Departure<p>The day has come!<\/p><p>After not quite enough sleep, we jumped out of bed and did some last-minute preparation: fold laundry, play guitar for the last time in a while, decide which shirts not to bring, make a Tim Horton&rsquo;s run.<\/p><p>Around 8:30 the first of our farewell party started to arrive. Becky made my morning with a peanut donut from Paula&rsquo;s. What a memorable time sharing our last hour in EA with so many special people. During our goodbyes, I did some good old-fashioned crying. Brian was surprised to see some raw emotion out of me. It was especially tough to say goodbye to Fiona and Max, who are growing so quickly these days. Fiona summed up the occasion well: &rdquo;You&rsquo;re going on a trip, Tio and Tess!&rdquo;<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/E4F88B04-C7FC-4603-ADA3-DDC39FFAD868-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>The Farewell Party<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/845F667E-081E-4BC4-AA3C-5F407D659645.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Rachele and Becky rode with us to Knox Road to see us off.

We hit some hills right off the bat on Jewett Holmwood and had to remember how to ride fully-loaded bikes. Tess had some gear trouble but sorted it out fairly quickly. Look at that high-vis gear!<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/47207BFF-EE4D-4855-BC0F-E6ACF43F2F6C-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Around midday we made it to Lake Erie. The road was smooth and fairly car-free on Old Lake Shore Road and it was good to have the lake breeze coming from the right. As we passed Mickey Rat&rsquo;s Beach Club we lamented that we&rsquo;d never made it there and remarked how glad we were that we were there early enough (maybe?) to avoid drunk drivers. We caught an ice cream truck and had some sweet treats. We then had the ice cream truck song stuck in our head for the next 15 miles (&ldquo;When The Saints Go Marching In&rdquo;).<\/p><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.0C49469E-3419-4072-B622-851B8F319F24.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><p>Once we hooked up with Route 5 it got a lot less scenic and there were a lot more cars. We did notice that cars were giving us a very wide berth thus far. Feels good to not want to be murdered by motorists.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/A1F6CE91-066B-4A3D-9E3F-91437C3979B6.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/E3E1C3F1-1468-40F6-9EC2-A88A27CCE30A.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/4F054B48-C7A1-41C3-982D-4EA24EBA459F.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Past Silver Creek traffic died down and it was smooth sailing. Around this point our knees started to hurt which wasn&rsquo;t encouraging. For now, chalking it up to it being our first long riding day in a while. We passed a terrible motorcycle accident by Van Buren Point which was a bit of a shock.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/38D6B38C-659D-4D0E-B7FA-9EC7A08BD6CC-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>It was a relief to get to Lake Erie State Park and get settled into our campsite - we were exhausted from all the emotion and exertion of the day. Dinner menu was Annie&rsquo;s mac and cheese with pesto (a Brian Whitney suggestion that is a delight) and a Paula&rsquo;s donut for dessert. After a walk and watching the sunset over Lake Erie, we got cozy in our new double sleeping bag and quickly fell asleep. A lovely first day.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/6AA496D6-04F0-4313-8AAF-325458EC80DE.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/56B3940F-87AC-4291-ADA2-20005D44F800.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/21EDAB02-45C0-48B6-B568-9AD432441E35.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Our little buddy <\/figcaption><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/628A663F-D25A-4C4B-BB6D-412F8CD42B16.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><\/h2>","date":"July 10, 2022","fields":{"date":"07\/09\/2022","miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"59","elevation_gain":"594","elevation_loss":"863","flats":""},"day_number":"1","weather":"Perfection","locations":{"single":false,"start":"East Aurora, NY","end":"Lake Erie State Park, NY"}}}
