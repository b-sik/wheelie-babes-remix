{"ID":2208,"title":"Day 84 &#8211; Boulder, UT to Escalante, UT","content":"<p>We&rsquo;d requested eggs, french toast, fruit, and coffee for breakfast at 7am so we could get into Escalante before storms rolled in. We chatted with Ellie as she prepared our food. She goes yearly to the Yucatan area so we discussed our upcoming trip and her affinity for freediving (diving without breathing assist). We also talked with the other guest staying there who was in Boulder for a creative writing conference. When we were getting ready to leave, one of the cats was perched on my bike seat. Hey,  free cat!<figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/CA041D28-C18C-4BCA-89E1-9E3789410F7B-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/423A9894-7766-4649-BC52-D1F9B25E1CF3-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We rode by big elephant skin rock blobs on our way out of Boulder, and hit some hills in the first few miles that Tess in particular was not expecting. We passed a biker, who like most people had some words of warning for us (in this case, that a biker had been killed around here), which we ignored.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/5FEEB69B-560F-43A9-AF7A-6631B325EAD3-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/80F3D7F2-0EBA-4A8A-9DFD-D4C68EE9C0FD-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/434C3BCD-207A-4BC0-9906-10F42656A69D-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We were totally unprepared - in a good way - for The Hogback, a stretch of Route 12 that falls away on both sides with sprawling vistas for hundreds of miles. It felt like we were straddling the spine of a massive rock creature. It only got better when we hit the long stretch of 14% grade descent down towards Escalante River. Many pictures were taken.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/405C54E4-BF67-458D-AF7B-5F0088EC12F2-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/26ABE122-6F1E-4B1B-B230-BEC6272D03F2-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/D3206DA8-B932-4F8E-BFF0-16BCA9CDD8CA-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1317EBEF-5D68-4199-A019-51F7068682B4-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/0AA7259E-6983-4A15-947A-86CFB3BC9AE3-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/86219E4B-1DAC-4B72-8B9A-D2DD95DA85EF-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/59075CD6-2F74-4529-80F5-44B6BA107F17-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/7E01E18C-8011-4968-8FDE-A6E082FFC43B-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/11E9B167-20DA-4223-8201-BE15C2A0DC2E-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.5B58C1AA-3AC4-485F-936A-95C4C214255A.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.ED5E53D5-835A-4ADD-9737-889FA23A1CE9.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><p>We ended up riding through red canyons by the river, and then starting a long climb. Before we&rsquo;d gone up very far we came upon Kiva Coffeehouse, a beautiful circular cafe built into the cliff with more than 180 degrees of view of the canyon below. I had a ginger brew and a gingerbread cookie, which I should have known was a little overboard on the ginger. Tess met a couple there that was from Troy, New York!<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/5788488D-AF28-4A6B-8CB8-71BF944BD8C1-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/EDC99158-F6D6-4C94-B9AC-99E9DF76E6DD-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/FB3D46E4-B23E-486E-9546-F095709B477A-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/5A60967D-F9BD-4F69-B4E5-4DF91A27754B-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/E5D9A3BC-9B52-4EFA-ABB6-E23F3A88880D-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We continued climbing for a while, eventually hitting a very steep section that brought us up to a beautiful vista. From there, it was all downhill to the town of Escalante. We planned to stay at Escalante Outfitters, which was an outdoor store that also had cabins, a campground, and a delicious pizza restaurant. Basically, paradise. We enjoyed it so much, we ended up not seeing any other part of Escalante.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/DFCAB910-6879-4B1C-9829-1C632DCDF736-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/58E93466-4631-42F9-B684-3F36B4A67DFC-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/B0A40520-144F-42DE-BC73-176A9BFF1D2C-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We shared a pizza for lunch which was absolutely scrumptious, followed by a brownie for me and cake for Tess. It was raining off and on at this point, so we chilled on the porch for a while. It was during this period that we met Jan and Inge, a bike touring Dutch couple who we had coincidentally first seen at breakfast in Hanksville, though neither couple knew the other was also bike touring. We hit it off instantly, and I mostly blame their good company for my lack of blog posts over the past week. We followed each other on Instagram - Inge thought we said &rdquo;really babes&rdquo;, which when typed in gave the result  &ldquo;really hot Asian babes&rdquo;.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/5BAD985B-30B1-4F2D-B11C-44FC34C0163A-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We got laundry, showers and naps out of the way during breaks in the rain, and then got a couple Smartwool hats at the gear store. The salesman had a lot of advice for us about bike touring and we pretended to listen. The first thing he&rsquo;d said was that since we were riding west we were &rdquo;going the wrong way.&rdquo; Apparently not if we made it here, man! We also met and talked with Patrick and Andrea, a very nice couple from northern Utah who were interested in and extremely supportive of our trip.<\/p><p>We of course headed back to the restaurant for dinner. I got a whole pizza for myself and Tess got a salad. More brownie and cake followed. Jan and Inge sat next to us during dinner and we talked with them all the way through pre-bedtime tea. They&rsquo;d only met a year and a half ago, and decided to go on a bike tour together after a successful camper van tour. They&rsquo;ve biked over 6,000 miles through the Netherlands, UK, Ireland, Canada and the US, both on and off-road. I expressed my desire to live in Amsterdam, inspired by my study abroad experience and the Youtube series Not Just Bikes. They were surprised but supportive. They were planning to head our direction the next day, so we loosely planned to ride together and then hit the hay. Tess and I never paid for our campsite there, but we spent enough money there that we didn&rsquo;t feel too guilty.<\/p><\/p>","date":"October 5, 2022","fields":{"date":"09\/30\/2022","day_number":"84","multiple_days":false,"weather":"Sunny, Afternoon Showers","locations":{"single":false,"start":"Boulder, UT","end":"Escalante, UT"},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"29","elevation_gain":"2805","elevation_loss":"3556","flats":""}}}
