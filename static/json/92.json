{"ID":2426,"title":"Day 92 &#8211; Baker, NV to Ely, NV","content":"<p>We got up fairly early and headed back to Sugar, Salt and Malt for breakfast. Outside we got talking with Elizabeth, who was taking a year off with her daughter to see the country by van. She bought us breakfast sandwiches and coffee! We got some baked goods after for later, and accidentally ate one right away.<figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/19DDBB54-46A7-47A0-A487-2B20A5196026-1006x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We had twenty miles fewer to go today, but we still had a long haul with two steep passes. After some difficulty locating a water source, we filled up our bottles and water bladders and slid on down the road. A few miles down, we joined Route 50 west, deemed &rdquo;The Loneliest Road in America&rdquo;. We quickly learned it was due to the lack of services, not the lack of other vehicles. Apparently there&rsquo;s a Loneliest Road &rdquo;passport&rdquo; that drivers can get at the Nevada border and if you go all the way across you get a certificate saying you did it. I think a t-shirt would be cooler.<\/p><p>We were starting to enjoy Nevada&rsquo;s whole thing. It&rsquo;s like Kansas in its barrenness but with mountains and clear benchmarks. Get to the top, have a snack, ride down. In Kansas, the only accomplishment was getting to the final destination. &rdquo;How many passes today?&rdquo; Is the first question of the day.<\/p><p>The first pass was long and gradual. On the way down we turned south through a valley with rows and rows of wind turbines, none of which were moving.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/F8AC4008-74D5-44CE-BAF2-468E6EA6DA9B-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/35927995-5F89-43C1-951C-908B71D9F6BF-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1285C1F3-2224-4696-A2C8-F360D7F35315-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/EAF8AE1F-23E9-4C0B-8FDF-6CB654D61D9D-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/4B8E9A3F-C78B-4A59-BB7A-147118EC4481-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/A94F4E11-C6C2-4A52-BEE5-595FB97C45CC-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/E2FC04B2-35DC-4C87-812C-AF2EFC862CE1-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Just before the next climb was Major&rsquo;s Station, a bar that maybe was also an RV park where at one time we&rsquo;d considered camping.

It was curvy, so at each turn we hoped to see the top but kept getting disappointed. Another thing we like about Nevada is that each pass has a green summit sign with the elevation.

This one made us particularly joyful.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1463DFF1-1670-484E-8EEA-E9FC80FF2E1B-769x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/7CCF69D7-7D36-4BBE-B7CC-5CB2294A1FA8-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/B117D752-8122-4A21-89F0-E756BEA5392D-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/03B47B99-62B5-49E6-B2D6-EE2256E48BEB-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>To the city of Ely (pronounced Ee-lee), it was another twenty-two miles of gradual downhill. The road was very straight and pretty busy, and we could see the town from 20 miles away so the last leg was torture. It just didn&rsquo;t seem to be getting any closer.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/9A91EA5B-F898-4B21-9D66-1275811DBC24-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Years later, we arrived in Ely and decided to stop at this cheap but highly-rated burrito spot. These things were humongous. We both got chile relleno burritos and I finished mine but Tess only managed to eat half. Afterwards we got really tired. We were staying with a friend of Jonny, who wouldn&rsquo;t be home for a while so we rode around to get a feel for the town. It kind of had a cool old seediness to it. When it was getting darker and we hadn&rsquo;t heard from Kyle we had a moment of desperation where we almost just got a hotel room at this old casino. Fortunately, right on cue we got the OK to head over to his place.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/97217391-9D97-43ED-BC83-FF8FD0627D30-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Kyle was super welcoming and friendly. He and his daughter were preparing to go on a full moon mountain bike ride that night, but got us set up in a school bus he&rsquo;s in the process of converting. Kyle works as the director of tourism for White Pine County, and also had a disc golf tournament to set up the following morning. Busy guy! We did our laundry, showered, made sure to get a picture with Kyle before he headed out, and finally got our much-needed sleep.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/8F89EF7E-7808-496E-AA55-47DF66825D11.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/93CDA60E-CD20-4E90-8273-4B784CF6D7AD-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><\/p>","date":"October 15, 2022","fields":{"date":"10\/08\/2022","day_number":"92","multiple_days":false,"weather":"Gud","locations":{"single":false,"start":"Baker, NV","end":"Ely, NV"},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"63","elevation_gain":"4521","elevation_loss":"3399","flats":""}}}
