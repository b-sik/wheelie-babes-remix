{"ID":2095,"title":"Day 81 &#8211; Hanksville, UT to Caineville, UT","content":"<p>Wanting to take our time in the stretch of Route 24 through Capitol Reef National Park (where the campground was full), we booked a night at Sleepy Hollow Campground 20 miles down the road. Therefore we treated it kind of like a rest day and took our sweet old time.<p>We sauntered over to Duke&rsquo;s Slickrock Grill around the corner for breakfast where I deviated from my usual omelette and got a stack of flapjacks. Tess ordered an omelette, so as not to cause imbalance in the universe. Our waitress was a sweet old lady named Shirley that addressed us as &rdquo;kids&rdquo;. Across the street there was a billboard-sized Wanted poster for Butch Cassidy.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/B93B7FBE-2AD9-4931-BF47-4F7DEE635D63-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/BD2436C2-114E-4F10-93D7-B9BC621FF52B-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We puttered around the hotel room until checkout at 11am. Our clothes were getting a little ripe so we decided to try the laundry room at the RV park behind Duke&rsquo;s.

We had the to-go burritos to eat but needed to keep them cold until dinner. We&rsquo;d planned to go back to the burger place for lunch. How would we refrigerate them until we left town? After too much deliberation, we realized we should just eat the burritos for lunch. When we took them out of the bag, we saw they&rsquo;d been labeled for us.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/622DE647-08DD-4747-B278-F511679D02A2-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Back in Laundrytown, the clothes were still wet? Switch to a different dryer, try again. In the meantime we got some cold Gatorades and groceries for dinner. Finally, around 3pm we had everything packed up and were on the road to Sleepy Hollow. The scenery quickly got interesting as we left Hanksville.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/0B906D83-FAD7-4B9F-94F7-0B5330241740-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/964A7AA7-D029-4059-B40B-8EC6C005B6E7-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/9D91B577-CD68-4232-8FDE-B81FE0CEBC69-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Factory Butte<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/7D18279D-009D-4109-B6E3-BA561C00708A-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/66BCE838-54DB-4A17-9A8B-2520A0B2B473-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/C2C88952-2458-4444-91B0-A0516D77116C-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Route 24 follows the Fremont River, and because of the moisture the valley was surprisingly rich and green for this part of the country.

The answer was to the section of road right outside the entrance to Sleepy Hollow Campground. Backhoes, cranes, steamrollers, all moving around and beeping. The drivers of two trucks with different functions working together were communicating by honking their horns to each other. Shaking our heads, we pulled into the campground to check in. There was a note on the office door to use the pay phone around the corner to call them if they weren&rsquo;t there. Fortunately before I got pissy the owner pulled up. He was really nice and he, too, was angry about the construction going on. Apparently they lied to him about how they were going to locate the drainage and now his property floods. There was only one other customer staying there in an RV. I felt bad for him. He said the road work should be done for the evening soon.<\/p><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.94C3958D-2717-4C55-8C5D-D85F306F48CC.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><p>We munched on veggies and hummus trying to talk over the construction sounds. After dinner and showers they were still at it. Eventually they shut the last vehicle off and it was nice and quiet.
