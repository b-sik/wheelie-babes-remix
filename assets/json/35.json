{"ID":913,"title":"Day 35 &#8211; Chester, IL to Farmington, MO","content":"<p>The alarm clock woke me from the soundest sleep I&rsquo;d been in all night in the brewery yard. As I sat up, the streetlamp that had been shining in my eyes all night shut off. The moon was huge in the western sky. We packed up in record time and set out for gas station breakfast, unsure what Missouri would bring.<figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/17BC8B1B-76BE-40D4-BA87-CEEDE37BDF7B-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/CA12263F-5AA7-48BF-B018-C962AC366CE4-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/4600BCDB-DC65-49CA-B282-DAAC5D68C3EA-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We left Chester and crossed the Mississippi into Missouri! Standing outside the Conoco just over the bridge we ate french toast sticks, hash browns, and hard-boiled eggs - not bad for a gas station.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/C21F3574-39AD-4A5D-9C7A-8C6FF5F51F0A-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/ADFEC16A-A247-4924-AE2F-113BFDB17001-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>The next several miles we were still in the floodplain so it was flat, but there were a decent amount of trucks. Eventually we hit the bluffs and went up into the hills. We were pleasantly surprised by the rest of the day&rsquo;s ride - plenty of ups and downs, but great scenery and fairly light traffic. We passed a tiger sanctuary that we didn&rsquo;t have any interest in checking out after having seen Tiger King. Around this time we officially passed the 1,000 mile mark!<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/17ECD8CA-5C69-420C-8BE6-20318D89ACDE.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/A20F1F70-4F9F-4EDD-BDEE-31BB568466D9.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/649CF0B4-9DE4-4A88-9D30-FE708AD0ABEC-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>In no time, we were in Farmington and it was still before noon. We were surprised to have passed a lot of wineries on our way into town, as this didn&rsquo;t strike us as wine country. Farmington is a fairly sizable town with a nice main drag. We planned to stay at Al&rsquo;s Bike Hostel right in the middle of the town after it didn&rsquo;t work out to stay with Bill, a local Warmshowers host who seemed like a really nice guy. We called to get the code into the hostel, and entered into a really cool space adorned with bike paraphernalia. There was no one there so we helped ourselves to the only room with a single bunk bed. We were so sleep deprived that we showered, had a sandwich and crashed.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/34401CF5-D765-4A46-A400-ACC3D1E36A56-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/B609E05D-3553-4973-9B5A-A77227DF5AA2-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>After a fantastic nap, we headed out to explore. Our first stop was Coljac Artisan Cafe where we got a couple coffees to shake ourselves out of our post-nap haze. We also grabbed some cold brews and muffins for the next morning. We talked with Chris, a local guy who gave us dinner recommendations and was really into my hat. He then described his favorite hat in great detail.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/79DC2EDD-D293-43EA-96DA-4F7FC62A68C0-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We hit up a couple other stores and then headed back to watch Glow and chill until dinner. Our dinner was a pizza, salad, and a decadent brownie at 102 Tap House to celebrate 1,000 miles. The waiter was impressed by our milestone and by how quickly we eat. We slept very well afterwards.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/F800F513-9D0D-4561-8006-DC5C8B6E054C-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/6C603182-FFBB-431A-ABFA-EDAE61136757-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><\/p>","date":"August 13, 2022","fields":{"date":"08\/12\/2022","day_number":"35","multiple_days":false,"weather":"Grand","locations":{"single":false,"start":"Chester, IL","end":"Farmington, MO"},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"46","elevation_gain":"2218","elevation_loss":"1703","flats":""}}}
