It was pitted and rocky, and <em>maybe <\/em>doable with suspension. I gritted my teeth and kept going, assuming this shit-path must end eventually. Confused campers looked on as we passed. Eventually after a mile or so I was swearing under my breath and uttering little things like &rdquo;completely ridiculous&rdquo;, and &rdquo;this is stupid.&rdquo; I heard a series of screams from behind me, which was Tess - I&rsquo;d gone too far ahead and she got scared. She was in tears at this point, walking her bike to me. I delicately said, &rdquo;Tess, we&rsquo;re not walking our bikes all the way up the mountain!&rdquo; <\/p><p>I was ready to power ahead, when a Forest Service pickup truck started to pass us. A ways behind, he and Tess were talking out of earshot. Apparently, 203 only got more rugged, and we should instead go back to 200 and take it all the way up to Marshall Pass. The grade was lower and it was less rocky, but it would take longer. Incredibly, both his parents were from East Aurora!<\/p><p>Boy, was I pissed. I was picturing the smug faces of the guys who gave us these directions, and picturing smacking those faces. Route 200 was slightly better, but looser and with large gravel mixed in. Every so often the dirt would get loose without warning and our too-thin tires would sink in, and we&rsquo;d have to quickly click out of the pedals as we skidded to a halt. Or we&rsquo;d hit a big piece of gravel and our heavy-as-shit bikes would shoot sideways towards the edge of the road. At each of these instances, Tess would scream or moan. I was emitting low growls.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/5D7B9A5B-4D76-4D43-A620-EC381FFD6498-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/0C386364-E33A-4AC9-9792-3FDD37B55EBD-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/409E38-42BE-40F2-8962-DFF619F4E761-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>After a while I started getting used to it, enjoying the scenery and taking each patch of quicksand as it came. I was even smiling. Tess wasn&rsquo;t feeling the same way - at one point she cried, &rdquo;just leave me behind!&rdquo; It was 12 miles from the bottom of 200 to the pass, and after a long while I looked at our progress&hellip;9.8 to go. It was going to be a long day. <\/p><p>Then things took a turn for the worse. Apparently they&rsquo;d just graded this section of road, and it became a mixture of beach sand and large rocks. Two feet, then our tires would sink in. One more foot, bike stopped. We&rsquo;d wade across to the other side of the road, thinking it looked more solid, and after ten feet, it became sand. We&rsquo;d hit a good patch, and then five dirt bikes would come through, forcing us to pull over. During the worst stretch, it took us an hour to go two miles. Whenever we took a second to stop and drink water, we would notice the scenery was pretty good. Mount Ouray loomed over us and we literally inched closer to it as we chugged along.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1D5C2C0D-FE1C-4B37-BDB9-9C607EB092ED-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/400DCC25-5E5D-4BE8-BD6C-9B07DBE87830-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/AD2331A5-D8B2-4351-963E-28A955875B1E-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/B3635E36-EFB7-416D-9877-EE2FB3C9EAC2-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Then - miraculously - we crossed a threshold into a different county or jurisdiction and the dirt became hard-packed.

We rounded a corner and a grand view opened up in front of us. How the hell we&rsquo;d done it, we weren&rsquo;t sure.

They also started telling us an alternate route for future days, and we nodded without listening. No more advice. Everyone&rsquo;s an expert. Sticking to the route.<\/p><p>Guess what? The road down sucked. It was washed out, pitted, and really rocky. We had to go about as slow as we were going on the ascent, because every bump would throw us and our gear sky high. My flip-flop fell off the bike on two occasions (rescued both times). Our spines, arms and shoulders were getting absolutely wrecked. The descent got me into a fury. The usual trick to get me through tough moments (it will be a great story later!) wasn&rsquo;t working. Shouts of anger the whole way down. The beauty of our surroundings was meaningless, as I didn&rsquo;t see any of it. Focused completely on every rock, bump, and ditch. Completely unsuitable for a fully-loaded road bike.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/D0F2D6E9-7446-4AA2-A2F7-DB3BB4D12841-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1C0B386F-150A-48E2-AA1B-93B84344636A-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/7D8AA786-87C3-4A8C-BF81-98E3768C02B9-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/D5C0FEA1-786A-400C-A7CD-38CC85F3D0C4-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/0EECB923-DE1C-4F8F-91EB-4588FB30DCA3-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>So infuriated was I that it took me a good hour, a burger and a beer to simmer down after we arrived at Tomichi Creek Trading Post in Sargents, Colorado.
