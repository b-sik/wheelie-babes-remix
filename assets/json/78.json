{"ID":1945,"title":"Day 78 &#8211;  Blanding, UT to Natural Bridges National Monument, UT","content":"<p>Our plan was to get breakfast at the last convenience store before the 120+ miles without services. We filled up our eight water bottles, my 2-liter Camelbak, and two 2-liter Platypus bladders for the stretch. We would not have water at Natural Bridges, but would be able to fill up the next night at Hite. We were guessing this would be more than enough.<figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.5709E624-925E-4439-AC69-59BAF19F9A93.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><p>At Shirt Tail Junction Store we got coffees, dried fruit and a couple oatmeal bars. The woman at the counter wasn&rsquo;t sure what she had in stock, as she &rdquo;hadn&rsquo;t been there in a month&rdquo;. In their little to-go refrigerator, we pulled out some very old hard-boiled eggs that had some brown juices inside the package. We stuck to non-perishable goods. The woman was actually very sweet and gave Tess some feminine wipes for the desert stretch.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1821CC85-3CD7-429E-A0D3-A693F6FD3CA8-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/32F3A097-3FBF-4263-B293-A171FDA14C76-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/CB5293D5-CAB8-4644-8A02-D1EF8EF735D2-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>It started to get more canyony with cool rock features pretty quickly as we rode down Route 95.

The views were really incredible. During this stretch, tiny little flies would gather around our eyes and mouth under the brim and just hover there. We were climbing slow enough that the air movement was minimal. No amount of arm flailing would get rid of them.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/8C0D3B97-BFF0-48F5-8E5B-7BC3579F2F3A-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/56A41C5D-6865-44FA-AE46-50EF70359DB0-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/E20D63F8-6959-4F7F-BB48-3064327FE677-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Towards the crest of the climb there were a couple really steep parts that got the blood moving. When we finally made it to the top, we ran into a couple tourers coming the opposite direction! Jordan and Kelly were working for the State Department in Paris and when that work period ended they decided to do a cross country tour from San Francisco to their final destination of Washington, DC. We exchanged numbers and got a picture before we parted ways.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/18B387E1-69CE-4E02-94E6-209534F1CB1D-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>From that point it was mostly downhill to the turnoff, after which it was another four or five miles to Natural Bridges National Monument. When we got to the visitor center, good news! There was a water spigot for public use, contrary to what it said online. The bad news was that the campground was full. The staff suggested we go back towards Route 95 and find some dispersed sites. That did not appeal to us, as we were wiped out from that big climb and the sun was getting hot. We sat in the shade and ate tortilla chips while we pondered. I was of the opinion we should wait a bit, check out the bridges, and then head back to dispersed camping. Tess thought we should ask someone at the campground if we could share their site, something that made me personally uncomfortable.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/965BA047-0332-42D4-A04C-A223A8041A5F-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/DE29F180-45DB-441B-B811-938845A67814-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/28F6E6E2-9BCE-4531-B960-FDEC0A21D6BB-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>While we sat there munching away, we got talking with Dan - on a road trip with his wife Emily and two daughters - who started a humanitarian organization in his home country of Kenya with Emily. They were very impressed with our trip, and brought their daughters over to meet us, hoping it would inspire them. &ldquo;What did you want to tell them?&rdquo; Dan asked them. &rdquo;Good job,&rdquo; they said quietly.<\/p><p>Ultimately, Tess put her foot down and we headed down the road to the campground to initiate kindness with some strangers. I hung back while Tess went forth with her New Yorker confidence. Very soon after she came back to collect me, giving me the thumbs up. Jeff and Gila from Munich had an RV and weren&rsquo;t using the tent area and offered it up to us. &rdquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be uncomfortable,&rdquo; Jeff said when I pulled up. He actually grew up in the New York City area and moved to Germany as a kid. I offered to pay half the site fee, which they declined. After chatting with them for a bit, Gila kindly said &rdquo;You don&rsquo;t have to talk with us just because we&rsquo;re sharing a site.&rdquo; Something refreshingly straightforward that an American would have trouble saying. We set up our tent in the shady little tent alcove and took a long, hard nap.<\/p><p>After 5pm Tess was still sleeping and might have continued all night if I hadn&rsquo;t wakened her, reminding her we still wanted to visit the bridges. We got on our light-as-hell bikes and hopped on the 10-mile loop road that would take us to the overlooks. The light-colored rock of the canyon was beautiful in the evening light. There are three main bridges to see, each in a different safe of development. We crossed paths with Gila and Jeff a few times on the loop. Jeff asked if we wanted a ride at one point, which I politely declined, unsure if he was joking. Tess later told me she would have taken the ride.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/88D4BF5E-F912-4E85-BF14-337CE46ED8E6-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/E10B1491-9CE7-48B1-8AB2-D15C4EB5F86F-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/58E02413-E1AC-48B7-815F-6500CFBB0383-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/C0F75E86-50D1-435B-8C98-391FC7430E68-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/5C8A93F7-2086-4EBA-86E4-E45F3FBD6FAF-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/16B277DB-3F14-44A3-BAF5-BA35AA5A5B4E-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/427A7CE9-571C-4AF3-8CA0-98C67F5351FB-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/66D5E382-D1B7-41BC-B0C8-4FA9589F3274-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/50862545-2A26-4D46-BD68-A311F4D236B9-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/5ED52830-3A03-455E-9989-4EBECA48419C-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/E9A9AA5D-E552-4C05-84C3-E888F9468695-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/A0825E60-E4F0-4FC8-BA89-7AE70787C22D-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/4F6B74FE-A297-4FE5-A470-B5A015A7A415-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>The road was ideal for road biking - little hills and dips, one-way traffic with almost no cars, and of course the beautiful scenery.
