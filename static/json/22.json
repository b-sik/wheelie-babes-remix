{"ID":601,"title":"Day 22 &#8211; Rising Sun, IN to Clifty Falls State Park, IN","content":"<p>I walked downstairs to Tess, Diane and Jeff talking at the table next to the most delightful breakfast spread - blueberry bread, a spinach feta egg dish, fresh cut watermelon, OJ and a pot full of coffee. The fog was so thick outside that the river was completely obscured. They told us about their recent week-long bike trip in Alaska and their 50-year anniversary &rdquo;50 days of adventure&rdquo;. Eventually the fog burned off the river and the sun started getting hot, a signal that we should forego the fifth slice of blueberry bread and start packing.<figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/6F6F206B-F05C-4EA7-AEDD-AD5FFBC7B1CF-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Jeff and Diane sent us off with hugs and the rest of the blueberry bread. We thanked them profusely and pedaled off. When going over our route with them over breakfast, they&rsquo;d warned us about the first hill we&rsquo;d take on Route 56 up and away from the river. I decided to film it to see how it came out&hellip;both the hill and the video turned out alright. Tess relieved herself to mark the occasion.<\/p><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.04D02A65-C16D-46FC-984C-F9079B6370F8.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/37C143E3-A368-413B-9D5A-0789A25DEA12-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Most of the morning, we had some of the best riding of the trip so far. Mostly sunny and cool, rolling hills through farmland, and very few cars. For me, this was the first day that it actually felt like we were biking across the country. The landscape and people had changed just enough to notice how far we&rsquo;d come.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/6A0DA2F9-A120-44DD-BB59-0A7AA8F86248-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1EBFEDB7-DB05-4E8F-82C0-F6F6D10E1888-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1AEFBC3B-F96E-4FA5-BE95-55097DF7B86C-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/50DD7C7F-12E5-497F-9F42-DCECCC894D68-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1D4C47B8-3C3D-42AE-928A-836F7A49DA75-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>It didn&rsquo;t take long before we stopped and demolished the rest of the blueberry bread, alternating spoonfuls of peanut butter.

We tried to look for good ways around that didn&rsquo;t add too many miles, but nothing looked promising.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/741364B3-EF61-4C03-AB7D-938567F988DC-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>To gravel or not to gravel<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/figure><p>We decided to go for it, as we only had 13 or so miles left. We had our first canine run-in not too far down - a couple big dogs ran into the road barking at me; thankfully the owner was outside and called them off quickly. I waited for Tess to catch up so the dogs didn&rsquo;t take her by surprise, as she hasn&rsquo;t had the best dog history lately.<\/p><p>The road turned from gravel to asphalt right as the downhill got really steep. We went down for a while, which would have been exhilarating if not for the knowledge of the uphill to come. The uphill was Lonnis Hill Road, probably the longest and steepest of the trip. I had to stop a few times to catch my breath, but made it and gulped down water at the top. I was watched by a bearded man carved into a nearby stump.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/2ABB44ED-40F8-46F5-94D8-C70C83148224-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>This hill was followed not long after by another one coming up Route 62, then it was pretty flat all the way to Clifty Falls State Park. Cousins Emily and Jim, who live in the Indianapolis area, had rented a campsite for us and we all planned to camp together for the night. After riding around for a bit and unpacking at the wrong campsite, we found the correct one. Emily and Jim arrived at exactly the same time, and we were psyched to see one another for the first time in several years! They had brought every kind of snack and drink imaginable, and we all immediately dug in and started catching up.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/41C16094-F38D-4867-A206-1008DC83CB51-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/E398B175-47B5-4336-BD35-CDD13118E8E9-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>They had brought fixings for their famous lentil stew, which was central to their courtship and proposal years ago. It turned out scrumptious, I had four helpings. We finished it off with some Trader Joe&rsquo;s fancy chocolate. This was probably the first time I&lsquo;d had one-on-one time with Jim and Emily as an adult, and I really enjoyed it. We discussed Emily&rsquo;s dream of walking the Camino de Santiago, and Jim&rsquo;s conversion of his van into a mobile home that he plans to take on extended trips. The evening finished with a spectacular sunset.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/B7EFD173-C50D-4306-AC58-7B72C639A6CA-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/74F1461A-9568-4499-A45A-798EABEA1A15-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/A7DEE616-4295-4610-A400-5EE8162076D9-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><\/p>","date":"August 1, 2022","fields":{"date":"07\/30\/2022","day_number":"22","weather":"Pleasing","locations":{"single":false,"start":"Rising Sun, IN","end":"Clifty Falls State Park, IN"},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"40","elevation_gain":"1496","elevation_loss":"1155","flats":""}}}
