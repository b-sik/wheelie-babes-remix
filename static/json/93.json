Needing to backtrack up a hill to get breakfast and groceries, we left our gear at Kyle&rsquo;s and biked unloaded to &ldquo;Nardi&rsquo;s home style restaurant&rdquo; (as stylized on Google Maps). This place had a Blue Lives Matter flag painted across the front, and the inside was covered in ultra-patriotic paraphernalia (game: count the number of places &rdquo;land of the free, home of the brave&rdquo; is visible). We were pretty unsure of our choice, but it was packed so we figured the food must be good. Wow, was it good. Thick homemade toast, deliciously seasoned potatoes (&ldquo;Nardi&rsquo;s potatoes&rdquo;), and a perfectly fluffy omelette. Excellent service as well. <\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/D0DE0132-33EE-447E-A505-82381C3FAABC-819x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/17D6B32D-1884-49BF-9351-10C7B34861EC-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>After a grocery run, we were getting pretty used to riding unloaded and were not looking forward to putting our gear back on. However, once we officially set off from Kyle&rsquo;s place, the familiarity of the weight was comforting. We only had one big pass today, and started the gradual climb right as we left Ely. At the top, Tess found a deer skellington.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/6BCC1E5A-5C8C-49F8-9360-15A82B428478-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/30C92101-94E4-4956-B454-657A007633F1-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Throughout the day there were little rainclouds scattered around us, but we didn&rsquo;t really feel any raindrops until we were getting close to our destination.

The campground was much more full than we expected, it being offseason, but Tess was happy to not be alone in the wilderness. All the campsites had a picnic table with a cover, and there were excellent views in every direction. As usual, it was almost completely silent. <\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1E8F24BC-21A5-4250-A33F-C0D479AA6537-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/257F4BB4-3481-4D1F-9788-94F9E24AF326-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/97C667A4-904F-4524-8640-BF31B20A0F1C-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/3DABCE65-46BB-4871-96D1-58A52F46235E-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/80FD0A49-9279-43FF-A4B9-132F2C9800AE-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>I had to use the pit toilet restroom, but when I opened the door, half a million flies swarmed around me. There was an overflowing garbage can inside with discarded sausage in it. I noped right outta there, screaming and running back to Tess. As the afternoon wore on, however, I could ignore my needs no longer. I suited up and boldly charged into the fly-clouded abyss. It was a horrid experience.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/29514450-DC3E-4738-9452-2864B19046F2-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>For dinner, we had Tess&rsquo; half a burrito chopped up and inserted into whole tortillas with fresh spinach, with a chocolate bar for dessert. As the sun went down, it got cold quickly but the valley was picture perfect. That night from inside our tent we heard a pack of coyotes howling. When nature called in the early morning, I got a picture of Tess in the near-full moon.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/BC52DBD8-AD30-4D58-B55F-CC79C68F8583-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/BEBBA87B-793E-492B-A6AD-EE30C90BAE8B-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/791E9C03-F891-4D10-BF6A-82D1A20B1297-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/74F4ED38-B77D-4247-A964-5EF577D29950-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><\/p>","date":"October 15, 2022","fields":{"date":"10\/09\/2022","day_number":"93","multiple_days":false,"weather":"Sun, Scattered Droplets","locations":{"single":false,"start":"Ely, NV","end":"Illipah Reservoir, NV"},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"38","elevation_gain":"1965","elevation_loss":"1637","flats":""}}}
