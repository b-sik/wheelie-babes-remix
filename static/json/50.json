{"ID":1235,"title":"Day 50 &#8211; Hutchinson, KS to Great Bend, KS","content":"<p>Fifty days on the road! It sure doesn&rsquo;t feel like it to us. We feel no road weariness yet.<p>Waking up at 3:30 felt wrong, so we snoozed until 4. We were upset to find out that the oversized cold brew bottle we&rsquo;d purchased the day before at the market was nowhere to be found. We ate our cereal and yogurt, packed up and pedaled off into the balmy darkness a little before 5.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/4CEEC10A-1C80-421A-B48B-87BFDDD33B51-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Just down the road we stopped at a gas station for a couple of those gross sugar and cream-filled Starbucks coffees. I had heart palpitations as we rode down the empty country road. It was exhilarating biking at night! Our headlights were built for this. It was a little nerve-racking once we got onto the highway to Nickerson and there were more cars, but after 7 miles we were back on quieter roads. Around 6:30 the sky started to lighten and this made for some good pictures.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/FFFF11A4-B82C-4DDF-99E4-3253F4F1F30D-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/676ACD23-376D-49D3-BAA9-95FE9822ECC8-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/6C5B056A-03EF-4531-881C-B2D4C3D43E7C-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/FC9C83A3-5A6B-4A69-8C3E-C98732F79BB0-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.C040193A-F123-4482-B0E1-E6273BC1577E.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><p>Most of our day was on the same country road that had really light traffic but a rough, gravelly surface.

Around 8 we finally had cloud cover! Once we hit Route 281 heading north, we destroyed the last 16 miles thanks to the tailwind. We got into the Super 8 Motel before 10:30, and despite being way early they got us into a room right away. We showered and got in bed in record time, but not before Tess captured her rad helmet hair. We had some more cereal and fell asleep.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/CF674C99-F034-49EB-9781-A1087047062D-769x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/F9765DC3-42EE-4ED6-A7EC-24935E5FE834-819x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>After our nap we did some laundry and laid around watching TV.

It was pretty good. The storm abated so we walked down the chainy American strip road to Braum&rsquo;s for some ice cream and watched the lightning to the south. We retired to our room for more laying around and got all packed up so we could leave right after our free breakfast the next morning.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/C089BE16-4C6A-46CD-A05C-1B493EC57B13-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/F5757088-E15A-4A2B-922C-2C8F16FEE839-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/32B747CE-6A20-4E02-8843-56DDB6A68CA9-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><\/p>","date":"August 28, 2022","fields":{"date":"08\/27\/2022","day_number":"50","multiple_days":false,"weather":"Cloudy, Stormy","locations":{"single":false,"start":"Hutchinson, KS","end":"Great Bend, KS"},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"64","elevation_gain":"371","elevation_loss":"52","flats":""}}}
