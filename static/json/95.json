{"ID":2520,"title":"Day 95 &#8211; Eureka, NV to Austin, NV","content":"<p>At our hotel breakfast where I ate way too much, we met a guy from Buffalo! What are the chances that one of the five other people in town was a Western New Yorker? Before we left the hotel, Tess finally left behind her now worthless bluetooth speaker (it no longer charges). It was actually our first joint purchase as a couple. Hopefully a savvier person than I can bring it back to life.<figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/B82F919A-EA62-45C1-9E20-17FA58481179-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Farewell, old friend<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/figure><p>We had a long 70 miler with one major pass at the end of the day. We started out with a headwind that worried us, but once we got out of the little canyon we were in the wind died down. It was pretty easy going for the first half or so. I believe I said the words &rdquo;Nevada is my favorite riding so far.&rdquo;<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/30E7A437-82A5-4B26-8B83-73EA87CDA369-1024x841.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/14001F61-5087-4482-828B-31789C3218DB-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/E02BB44A-C4D0-41F9-AB6D-AC295A2FCDBD-1006x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/4CB3FA0C-A2C4-4D4A-B803-A681D7E334F3-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Then we hit a loooong straightaway and started to kind of zone out. Never a good thing. Too late, I looked up and saw that Tess&rsquo; rear wheel was right in front of mine. Our tires ground together, I veered right and toppled over down the pretty steep gravel incline to the right of the pavement. My shoulder absorbed most of the fall, and I was lucky the gravel was loose because it softened the impact. Besides some scrapes to my leg and elbow, everything seemed to be fine. We continued on, and a little later I fell again for the same reason but mostly caught myself.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/9E844DCA-02FD-4375-95CB-E5FC1240FD8E-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Scrapes after a couple days<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/A19CD3AB-67C9-4BDD-B3D9-4197A660E62C-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Then all the vehicles on the road started to get aggressive for seemingly no reason (or had our patience just waned)? Tess began getting cramps and we had to pull over so she could have diarrhea in the bushes. Over the crest of a little pass, we got blasted with headwinds that made the descent quite unpleasant. We crawled towards the bottom of the mountains we&rsquo;d have to conquer to get to Austin. It was during this stretch that we decided San Francisco would be our last stop, and we wouldn&rsquo;t be biking down the coast as planned. We&rsquo;d just had it with cars.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/965109BE-C39A-4C80-9ADD-09A80D91B2A1-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/F1BE0A4B-0CF6-4FCB-A39C-C131552D581A-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Then, the most difficult pass in Nevada thus far. Winding, very steep, and not very good shoulders. We got honked at a couple times as well. The last time sent me over the edge. I screamed some really foul things at the driver of the pickup in question. I fumed to the top of the pass, and then all the way down past gorgeous views into the little town of Austin.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1EC35D65-1D8E-4929-88C2-004019B992EA-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/4174B434-F39A-4A9B-8C75-464F8ADEE1ED-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/8043270A-F6E7-4B2C-9BD5-534B24BF8410-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/89C5A3B4-5B0E-4DCA-8E46-57B222D23C96-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Talking to Sarah, the kind owner of Cozy Mountain Motel, slowly calmed me down. She said that there were no restaurants open in town that night, but that she and some friends were hanging out at the closed Grandma&rsquo;s Restaurant up the street and they could fire up the pizza oven for us. Music to my ears.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/7FB42D5D-BF50-444A-9C0C-D9C0B096F081-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>I fake sobbed as I took the most relieving shower of my life.

Sarah, who used to work there, took good care of us as we sat at the bar. We had a delicious salad and humongous pizza, and we were finally relaxed. After thanking them profusely, we wandered down to the gas station for a little dessert and then headed to bed.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/9D29A3DF-145E-4961-A88A-EFE0EA6E7A7F-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/C1B7F491-B0A3-41EC-BC13-57F5AF9FCEA3-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/7C0BC12E-4515-43C4-9F7D-DAD6D42C07EC-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/C703D678-9260-461E-B107-1F0616523AD8-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/3FDB64B6-DA58-4235-A236-D2C1D3DB777B-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><\/p>","date":"October 16, 2022","fields":{"date":"10\/11\/2022","day_number":"95","multiple_days":false,"weather":"Pretty Hot","locations":{"single":false,"start":"Eureka, NV","end":"Austin, NV"},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"70","elevation_gain":"3104","elevation_loss":"3077","flats":""}}}
