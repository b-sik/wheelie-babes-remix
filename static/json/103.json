{"ID":2705,"title":"Day 103 &#8211; Plymouth, CA to Sacramento, CA","content":"<p>For breakfast we walked down the main drag to Fig Barn, the town&rsquo;s brand new coffee shop where I got avocado toast and Tess got an unexpectedly massive breakfast salad. We also couldn&rsquo;t resist getting some pumpkin muffins. We were super tired when we got back so we fell back asleep, and didn&rsquo;t leave until 11:30. With only 40 miles to go to get to our friend Hannah&rsquo;s house outside of Sacramento, we weren&rsquo;t in any rush.<figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/78697BD9-DBCF-4F14-8434-E8E8005169EF-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/ABA9E1A4-50F6-4E83-B74E-67FAA4BD8735-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>More downhill at the beginning of our ride, through fields with dry brown grass and gnarled trees. We felt very much like we were in Italy. After we joined the busier Route 16 with extra-wide shoulders, we passed through Rancho Murieta where we had originally planned to stay the night before, and felt extra glad we&rsquo;d stayed in Plymouth. A high-walled gated community with a large golf course and lined with barbed wire, it felt quite exclusive and we got the sense that some of its residents were a bit scared of the world outside. <\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/4C243270-D777-4A8C-BED3-7A6C396B4A17-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/559B693A-D6D5-4B89-8734-7201DB614B2E-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/73C795AC-1A9B-47E0-9A12-3F4F0B3A12E0-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/39C38241-6378-4B71-AB60-77620CD91DCB-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/70A14F32-A703-4662-B1E8-0B90B149042A-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We turned north from Rancho Murieta and the riding got slowly less enjoyable. People in sports cars were having a little too much fun accelerating around curves and not being particularly careful. The unpleasantness came to a climax on Prairie City Road, where we were getting honked at by semis and where we hit a steep hill leading up to a freeway interchange. &rdquo;Middle lane! Middle lane!&rdquo; I frantically shouted to Tess. Thankfully we survived this bit, and were rewarded with a beautiful bike path along the American River that led almost all the way to Hannah and Daniel&rsquo;s house. It was well used and in great condition.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/E0BB8905-743C-469B-BCD6-F729C7CD5CBE-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/AD93EF09-71E0-48AC-9745-F6C9A7A49536-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We stopped at CVS to get medicine for Tess, which lasted about an hour due to some confusion around our health insurance card. A bit cranky, we headed to our friends&rsquo; place as they&rsquo;d just gotten home. Hannah was waiting outside with their dog Rami. Tess taught in Spain with Hannah in 2013, and we hadn&rsquo;t seen her since our wedding in 2016, yet it was like no time had passed. Daniel came home a little after, and after a nap we all went into Midtown Sacramento for dinner at Bambi, which specializes in vegan tacos (the &rdquo;al pastor&rdquo; with marinated mushrooms, jalape&ntilde;o sauce and pineapples was a standout). We then wandered around Midtown, which was packed with beautiful overhanging trees and gave us New Orleans vibes. It was delightfully balmy. We got a drink at Lowbrau and had an artful photo shoot in the pink neon light. A lovely evening with a lovely couple.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/F12DA8B5-72C6-42B9-84D0-3D149E9421BB-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/9154E03D-41F5-4A73-ABBD-2E1C7DCA8D03-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/45803233-F0E6-41BD-8A96-72105EA06E04-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><\/p>","date":"October 21, 2022","fields":{"date":"10\/19\/2022","day_number":"103","multiple_days":false,"weather":"Sunny","locations":{"single":false,"start":"Plymouth, CA","end":"Sacramento, CA"},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"44","elevation_gain":"1122","elevation_loss":"2129","flats":""}}}
