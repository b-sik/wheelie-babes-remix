{"ID":762,"title":"Day 29 &#8211;  Sebree, KY to Cave-In-Rock, IL","content":"<p>We&rsquo;d grown fond of Kentucky, so we were sad this would be our last day there. All morning, Kentucky &rdquo;showed us her feathers&rdquo; (Tess&rsquo; words), and we had the best riding of the trip in terms of scenery and roads hands down.<p>Knowing it was going to be a hot one and there was a chance of t-storms in the afternoon, we got up before sunrise. Due to how comfortable we were at the hostel, we took our time and didn&rsquo;t leave until 7:30. That time would matter later on.<\/p><p>Dips and thickets from Sebree to Clay, with beautiful blue skies. For the first hour or so before we stopped in Dixon for coffee, mist was draped over everything.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/E39C8A00-C9E5-4457-8338-7C4848D64B9E-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/9D639824-D712-4726-813A-D745B5FF5F0B-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/7A8ACE01-78C2-4103-B234-282532D65DD1-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/84D04024-B3A5-443B-97A0-F7E33428D6A4-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We stopped at Classic Cafe for coffee, which was attached to a Marathon gas station and seemed to be the only breakfast game in town.

There were so many clouds in the sky, yet it seemed like the sun was always beating down on us, and always on an uphill. At one point Tess called me and asked to find some shade because she wasn&rsquo;t feeling good. We pulled into a little driveway and hunkered down for a bit, snacking and drinking until we felt ready to continue. When we left, we set the bibles down on the fencepost.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/3DD3283B-14F9-407D-ABD6-2076D06C349C-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>The 10 miles to Marion where we planned to restock on cold water and snacks felt like forever.

Steve had been laying down due to his back problems, and slowly came out to help us. He wasn&rsquo;t in any hurry to say what he was saying, and looked far off into the distance as he spoke. We waited for change for our twenty for about ten minutes. Eventually we headed off to snag a site by the bath house. Horse flies dive-bombed us from then on.<\/p><p>After some showers, we immediately became sweaty again and walked through the woods to the Lodge Restaurant. We split a salad, fried green tomatoes, waffle fries and two slices of pecan pie with ice cream.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/62F055E0-E5BC-438A-B208-82DEE952616C-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>The second slice turned out to be a poor choice. We wandered out of the restaurant into the heat to find the cave everybody was going on about, and I think all I needed was a few good burps, but I can&rsquo;t burp, so I was miserable. The cave was pretty cool though. Check out the pictures if you don&rsquo;t believe me.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/AF329D24-2480-4AE2-8249-18E7F822189F.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/55E921BC-A75F-4234-BC79-A101C8B31B70-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/8989F6F4-9BB1-4A44-B828-431C784BA4A6-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/2B0870B8-7E00-4A71-8932-25503FBE3E4A-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/A4545889-5E92-4426-922E-327E0871FC74-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/D6908DFF-D240-478C-B4C8-FA863011C68B-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/F99B48E0-AF6D-4206-BED0-4CD0D5E16438-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We were so tired by this point that all we wanted to do was sleep, but it was too hot and muggy.

I had Tess take a picture of my misery, to remind myself that this wouldn&rsquo;t be forever.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/30ACFD44-426B-47A4-ACED-B46D36893B93-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/11793A66-5D27-4048-9776-496C12EA25DE-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>I tried again later and I think I fainted rather than fell asleep. Later that night I woke up and noticed the stars were visible through the tent ceiling and got out my Sky Guide app - Cassiopeia, Andromeda and Jupiter were in view. <\/p><p>This spectacle was interrupted by some grinding noises from outside. I shined my light out the tent door and a raccoon was digging through our stuff. When we got out we found it had opened up Tess&rsquo; handlebar bag and thrown stuff everywhere. Sadly some bars Tess had left in her bag were taken. Tess screamed &rdquo;My Bobos!!&rdquo; Fortunately, our food bag was safe inside Tess&rsquo; Ortlieb pannier which had withstood the raccoon&rsquo;s attempts to get inside. We slept poorly after that, listening for sounds of more critters prowling. A picture-perfect day had ended in some adversity which we would fondly recall later.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/5784E942-1220-49E8-B462-7913725C9255-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><\/p>","date":"August 7, 2022","fields":{"date":"08\/06\/2022","day_number":"29","multiple_days":false,"weather":"Nice, Then Flames","locations":{"single":false,"start":"Sebree, KY","end":"Cave-In-Rock, IL"},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"56","elevation_gain":"1549","elevation_loss":"1483","flats":""}}}
