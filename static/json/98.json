{"ID":2578,"title":"Day 98 &#8211;  Middlegate, NV to Fallon, NV","content":"<p>We love when we&rsquo;re staying somewhere where we can stumble half asleep to get breakfast before we even begin thinking about packing up. The Station didn&rsquo;t disappoint, delivering the largest omelette of the trip so far. Just look at that thing.<figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/63E66319-3348-435A-8AB7-6D4AA14265CC-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We saw the gents over breakfast and said our goodbyes, then got packed up. Outside, Navy fighter jets were practicing dogfighting at high altitude, causing quite the ruckus. The day ahead was shorter than the usual Nevada day, and mostly flat. Good with us! <\/p><p>We passed Sand Mountain, a massive sand dune just sitting there amongst some mountains. Unlike Great Sand Dunes, you could drive buggies all over this thing, so it was packed with RVs.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/5392C22A-73ED-4FD7-BF85-658F6C6950E0-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/EC9F91A6-3223-49BF-AEBD-BFC5CE6AB57C-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1EB58F99-D3CE-463A-9B43-D8472E46B12F-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/463FE2D8-5721-4A64-8C28-8B71EA59C62A-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>The signs denoting open cattle range in this area are really something. I call them &rdquo;flirty bull&rdquo; signs. I got a good chuckle every time we passed one.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/3E38A8CF-3CE9-47D0-B4E4-F48659023DF6.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>The rumble strip shoulder lasted pretty much all the way to Fallon, unfortunately. There were side-by-sides being driven all over the place to each side of us as we rode. There was a long stretch where people had written their names and messages with rocks over white sand along each side of the road. Someone even spelled out the entire preamble to the US Constitution! We were grateful for something to look at, because this stretch was otherwise flat and quite boring.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/BDEA07E5-DD05-4CDA-A2E3-F48EED8706DF-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/B795FB51-42A0-4CE3-9D0D-F0648FD9D87D-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Just when we were getting fed up with Route 50, Google took us over a back road to our motel that was quite pleasant. There was even a little canal running alongside it. One drawback was the malodorous waste treatment plant we passed.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/CCFA2C69-163D-4E35-9814-997589B5BFB8-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We rode into the town of Fallon past our motel to grab some lunch at The Slanted Porch. It seemed like a pretty nice town, one of the most prominent features being a large naval air base. We split a greek salad and veggie sandwich, and reveled in the freshness of the food.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/6FA1AEE7-4417-4442-92F9-70284BA0681B-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Afterwards we rode back down to Motel 6, checked in, showered and napped. For dinner we walked to the parking lot next door and got Indian food from a food truck. The family running it was very nice, and their son Sahid was very talkative and extremely cute. He only allowed Tess to touch his WWE belt after he taught her some moves and she proved her worth. The food - veggie korma, saag paneer, cheese naan - was absolutely delicious. We slept very well that night.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/4163581B-1A80-46DC-9956-5040D9563889-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1D910706-E7AD-4390-B138-6EC7F7C661C7-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/7D4EAB7D-40C1-4596-ABC2-D7C71062E99E-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><\/p>","date":"October 17, 2022","fields":{"date":"10\/14\/2022","day_number":"98","multiple_days":false,"weather":"Merry","locations":{"single":false,"start":"Middlegate, NV","end":"Fallon, NV"},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"46","elevation_gain":"817","elevation_loss":"1457","flats":""}}}
