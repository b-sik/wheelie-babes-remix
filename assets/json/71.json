A bunch of neighborhood dogs guided us out. We drank our coffee and had some bars on the bridge down by the river.<figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/6150762D-26E1-4FA2-924F-B52E32D9E88A-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/5B1A48-0447-4942-8B77-6F56A02361EB-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>The road to Telluride was one of the most beautiful of the trip.

There was no doubt about it, Telluride was gorgeous and there was clearly a lot of money there. The high school looked like a college campus. We stopped and had breakfast at The Phoenix Bean. There, we struck up a conversation with Jenn from Seattle who was in Telluride for the festival with her partner. They had planned a bike tour down the coast to Panama but set off right before COVID hit, which forced them to cancel. She was super friendly and asked if we needed anything. We exchanged numbers so we could potentially meet up at the after-hours blues concerts that night.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/38B11A91-CD14-4457-B42C-DEB8D0E83B10-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/84B1EC5B-6696-4D33-9CFB-2202674CD0A8-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/638DC9E8-9FA2-4944-BFE3-3F3AE3C34836-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/DDB8BD47-C5B5-4210-9BA5-C2A0DFC86F0C-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/9C34765F-0B1E-48D5-ABE4-48CA737D4B9D-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>After our breakfast sandwiches we were still peckish so we walked around the corner to Baked in Telluride and got a couple baked goods. We saw the folks from Quebec there again! Despite the fact that we had a place to camp up the mountain, we really were hoping for a place right in town, so everyone we talked to we were feeling out whether they were locals or not. We also wanted to find a way to charm ourselves into the festival. We weren&rsquo;t having much luck. Tess kept calling the locals &rdquo;Moneybags&rdquo;, though not to their faces.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/ECD3EB2F-553E-4F0E-9B77-D6B21CCA4DA5-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/E6AF9ADC-BD2A-495A-8671-AE8C9550FA01-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Wouldn&rsquo;t you know it, right as we were walking away from the bakery we ran into Jenn again, this time with her partner Dalan. He heard about our situation and took control. &rdquo;Just walk in with us, and act confident. You can set up your tent by ours.&rdquo; As little rule followers, we were a little nervous but it worked out! We squeezed in behind another tent, and got an $80 value campsite on the grounds for free. We made friends with the other campers around us and they were supportive of our plight. <\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/43F2388D-B34B-4733-9931-4CC123DB8BEC-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Lucky for us, one of the stages was in the campground itself, which allowed us to attend shows without passing official wristband checkers. Even so, we felt naked with no wristbands and kept our hands mostly in our pockets on the way there. We caught an excellent blues band from Brooklyn with a gospel vibe that soon had the (almost entirely white) audience dancing their tookuses off. The four of us, plus their friends Ariel and Anoop (sp?) all got along really well. Now we were starting to envision a reality where we move to Seattle&hellip;<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/7A150F41-0F0C-48BC-B311-ED3D3C58067B-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.260D481C-9ACD-4FFA-86B0-48A50B0C4F97.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><p>Afterwards our new friends went into the festival proper, and we hung out a little bit at the campsite with neighbors Gabby and Jaden from Steamboat Springs. When they too left, we kind of wandered for a bit, and then we were getting really tired so we laid in the tent. There, we realized we hadn&rsquo;t had any water since breakfast. We went to hang out by a creek with a bunch of water bottles, and when we got hydrated we wondered: what are we doing hanging around this empty campground when we could be exploring the town? We got a single cheap campground pass for insurance in case we got stopped on the way back in, and then walked into town.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/3FAB5FB1-3F39-4ED4-950A-FC5926FBB3DB-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/D8B21434-805C-4B71-A484-97890873F4C1-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Downtown Telluride was looking lovely in the early evening light. We stopped at The Butcher and the Baker and split a fried green tomato burger and a salad. When the food arrived both dishes were covered in poppyseeds (Tess is allergic), so we picked the seeds off the bun and ordered a new seedless salad. For dessert I had a very mediocre cookie. Overly crunchy.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/0609CEE4-8844-4972-BBBE-8252E10CF97E-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/52CB2D4C-60F0-4AC2-87F2-76C0EDC905E8-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/8F1DC4D8-DA1E-46BF-8AA5-D5478161185C-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Tess was in agony grappling with the decision of whether to go to the 10pm-1am music showcase in town with the Seattle crew or go to bed at a reasonable time. We decided to walk around town for a while and see how we felt. We&rsquo;d been gifted bracelets that mimicked the legit after-hours wristbands; we would try to use those if we ended up going. I had to hold mine together with a piece of gum.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/9F0B2162-1546-42AB-8EE3-A5EAAC1F2E3D-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We tried on some expensive Telluride outfits in one store to see if we could make it in a Moneybag world. Didn&rsquo;t feel very natural. When it was getting dark and only 8pm, we gave into the fact that we were not going out late and walked back to our campsite. Earplugs in, lights out.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/38BC8FAB-7695-4615-9DA3-95D909B96079-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/7462C695-67D6-4B66-9F4A-B21661FA62FD-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/E6CD6658-BB48-4FFA-BD87-50E2555C4DF5-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/9A6AF393-3053-48B0-AA2E-4F64BDECD576-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/60F03E3A-BD9F-43F8-8C5D-B66963B393F4-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/F924BCF1-10D4-4119-BB61-0E7206B79C2B-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><\/p>","date":"September 21, 2022","fields":{"date":"09\/17\/2022","day_number":"71","multiple_days":false,"weather":"Splendid","locations":{"single":false,"start":"Placerville, CO","end":"Telluride, CO"},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"16","elevation_gain":"1496","elevation_loss":"92","flats":""}}}
