{"ID":734,"title":"Day 28 &#8211; Utica, KY to Sebree, KY","content":"<p>We decided on a shorter day today. There&rsquo;s been a bunch of rain in the area and more to come so our original camping location in Dixon seemed less appealing (and we hadn&rsquo;t heard back from them).  Furthermore, the Adventure Cycling app showed a church in the closer town of Sebree with &ldquo;hostel-like accomodations&rdquo; for cyclists. Sounded pretty dry to us.<p>The morning was pretty damp and muggy. As Ang&eacute;lica said, it was &ldquo;air you can wear&rdquo;. She made us coffee and hard-boiled eggs with cereal and after a selfie saw us off. Tess said goodbye to her favorite of their many cats Milagro. We were back 5 minutes later to get Tess&rsquo; bite plate and said thanks and goodbye again.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/A1205DB6-A8CC-4816-AB0B-63F502956B83-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/703527-8E27-4A85-A2D5-1DDEA4C9D844.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/59948FDC-A288-4EF4-9750-EA5C5ED75311-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/C3E58303-5EE0-4FC9-96AD-A9BAB7964A53-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>A half a mile down the road and we officially joined the Transamerica Bike Trail!

The quiet country roads brought us some nice little curves and hills that momentum usually carries us over.

Some of my favorite conditions.<\/p><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.B1DDCFF4-B11C-4952-81C8-FEA3B3823BC9.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><p>Tess requested a stop to eat a piece of a Bobo bar and we happened to be in front of what looked like a little store with &ldquo;Ideal Dairy Products&rdquo; painted on the side. Tess was crossing her fingers for yogurt and went to investigate. The door opened from inside and she was welcomed in. <\/p><p>We&rsquo;d stumbled upon the leather shop of the Dants, a couple who had retired and chosen leather crafting as a hobby to share. They were hanging out with their friend Reno, and offered us cold bottles of water. We had a nice chat with them, and they let us pick from a series of little leather crosses to take with us. We&rsquo;re not religious, but the giving spirit we&rsquo;ve encountered on our trip so far has been very in line with Christian teachings, so we happily took them and fixed them on our handlebars. <\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/871ACB5C-BA07-44F0-B7E2-ED1590A806B8-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>They had a bunch of chickens behind the shop, and they let an excited Tess hold some chicks.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/400A8A44-617E-4344-93EB-64BF50CBB4EE-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/02CF8591-0D88-4CAA-A868-6812F14C5A35-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1B39CC06-BB77-48EB-8ABD-415F81294989-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/7D1CA836-2FB3-46DF-9C24-ABF07A4CFB48-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>It was pretty clear we were in chicken country, as trucks would pass us one way loaded with chickens and empty ones were coming back the other direction.

We arrived at the First Baptist Church, and immediately we were greeted by the smiling Dylan, affiliated with the church and intent on showing us around. We were completely blown away by the amenities they provided, everything spotless and perfectly air-conditioned - TV lounge, pool table, ping pong, full kitchen with a bunch of free food, bathrooms, showers, laundry, and a &ldquo;cyclist room&rdquo; with a ton of take-what-you-need materials. I said, &rdquo;this might be a silly question, but is this free?&rdquo; He assured us that it was, and they prefer not to accept donations from cyclists. <\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/84FDEFA5-61B0-4CA9-A264-B7D65C0C4306-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/771D2D08-DB9F-4F2A-A428-95F5E346E46C-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/708FC4F5-A6FC-4FA8-8874-344EB58B4E6F-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Our room<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1BEFA448-F554-45C4-929A-232ED42F22C5-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>What&rsquo;s more, we had it all to ourselves for the rest of the night. We quickly settled in, taking naps, doing laundry, and watching TV. Sebree has a sizable population of Mexican heritage, and we went grocery shopping at a Mexican grocery store.
