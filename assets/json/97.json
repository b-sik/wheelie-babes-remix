{"ID":2558,"title":"Day 97 &#8211; Austin, NV to Middlegate, NV","content":"<p>Grandma&rsquo;s was open for breakfast today! We wasted no time walking up there, Tess ordering an omelette and I ordering a breakfast burrito. We met some other travelers while we ate, but Tess did most of the talking. I just didn&rsquo;t have it in me this morning. The only thing in me was the burrito.<p>We had a fairly big day ahead of us, but we&rsquo;d get most of the climbing out of the way early. Our destination was a bar in the middle of nowhere aptly named Middlegate Station, where you could camp for free. There is a town called Middlegate on the map, but it&rsquo;s really just this bar.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/8ED761CD-C181-4DA9-8C73-6C1A8E38F8D1-1024x945.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>It was a pretty straightforward day of riding, made easier by the rest we&rsquo;d gotten the day before. On the second smaller climb we were getting a bit hot, and right on cue a couple from Ottawa pulled their van over and supplied us with water and cold bananas. They were cyclists themselves and knew how it could get in the middle of the day. Trail magic abounds in Nevada!<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/58FD0828-8BBE-40BE-83E2-E7D1CC273B33-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/775020CE-E6BE-4E8D-B55E-A32D52DAF979-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/413D33DB-F2FA-42FC-A22C-F4EC759E6E90-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/7BFFF790-B209-4394-8411-E68DC5A2DDF5-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>As we began the gradual descent down to Middlegate the shoulder narrowed and became a rumble strip, so we were forced to ride in the lane. A big headwind hit us around this point as well, so we really had to grind out the last few miles. We stopped at the Shoe Tree, which was draped with hundreds of pairs of shoes and unsurprisingly smelled like feet.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1555265A-FE2A-456B-81B0-1F462E460C1F-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Right before we turned into Middlegate Station a truck passed us far too close at breakneck speed, taking Tess by surprise and causing her to curse loudly for the next few minutes. She simmered down after we entered the cool old bar, sat down and enjoyed some cold fizzy beverages. We had excellent vegetarian chicken sandwiches for a late lunch. Just out of curiosity, we asked how much their motel rooms were and were very surprised they were only $45. Tempted by the allure of a hot shower and a nap, we sprung for one.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1EF883C1-0D28-4AFE-9A86-3FD92A766923-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/30B1F988-57DA-4488-88BA-59D561014398-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/30A63306-1B45-479F-A38C-D3929D5765C4-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Outside our motel room, we met three guys that we&rsquo;d seen during lunch and who were in the area for a few days to ride the backcountry in their side-by-sides. They were blown away that we&rsquo;d come all the way from Buffalo, and got pictures of us to show their wives. David gave us fruit and some cheese danishes. They also had rooms here so we thanked them and said we&rsquo;d probably see them later on. Showers and naps! The rooms were pretty rugged but perfectly suitable for the price.<\/p><p>That evening we strolled around the grounds and then sat outside having cold beverages. Once it got cold we continued inside. We saw David, Frank and Alan inside getting dinner and talked to them a bit more. They got a round for us, and we all got a picture together.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/E903250F-BCF9-4B8E-89D3-176183752BBE-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/0D83B4FD-6ED5-46D7-9EA5-734D8E86B145-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/00969A95-D84D-47EF-A280-30CE4C0C016F-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/60B03081-8037-41AA-ABA2-C9469767FDB3-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/8877A6CD-C355-4FC2-8421-0B82DAA19139-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/56770F86-78BB-47E5-BA59-6AEA04EB154A-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/174F70A1-E40A-43FC-9875-54062B241EE4-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>They invited us to join them at their fire but we were ready to get cozy in bed.
