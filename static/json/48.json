{"ID":1206,"title":"Day 48 &#8211; Newton, KS to Hutchinson, KS","content":"<p>Janet and Orvin drove us to Bread Basket, a diner with an all-you-can-eat buffet style. Here&rsquo;s what went on my plate: French toast (4), scrambled eggs, home fries, fresh fruit, and a cinnamon roll. We talked about a lot of things, including reasons for having (or not having) children. Tess said she walked away with a changed outlook.<figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/FA96E2B3-3E2A-4362-A986-9AE15FA34C3C-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We didn&rsquo;t set off until after 8, which was fine as we had a shorter day ahead - 47 miles to the city of Hutchinson. We said our thanks and made sure we got our selfie with Orvin and Janet.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/6E524D1B-C1B9-458E-9A54-8ED1BCAF6F41-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>It was pretty straightforward riding for most of the day, albeit hot with not much breeze. Before long we were in Buhler to stop by Mustard Seed, another recommendation from Ian (in this case, for the oatmeal raisin cookies). We didn&rsquo;t stop for long, as we wanted to get out of the heat. We loaded up on cold brew and cookies and skedaddled.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/D122C7F4-B3E0-4D1E-9F99-DED4E4ADE8E2-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/AA0E84A1-6205-452C-92B1-A25D0DE5B52E-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/593BBEB0-2A8B-458C-B731-1E90413440CF-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Hutchinson is actually off the trail by six miles, so we had to use Google Maps to get to our destination, Harley&rsquo;s Bicycles. There, we would get a key to the bike hostel in the basement of Zion Lutheran Church. There was a neat little ramp entrance down to the hostel from the street. As usual, there was no one else there and we made ourselves at home. The beds were on a little stage and divided by curtains, and each room had a little TV with a selection of DVDs.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/BF814545-87FC-47BE-8191-B544220A70CD-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/ADEACA2A-3A73-42D8-A7FF-7B6B324D381D-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1F80F6F2-EDEF-4C5D-9CC9-C016EF517F09-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We showered, turned on the AC, and headed back to Harley&rsquo;s to get our bikes looked at - mine for my front derailleur and Tess for her usual shifting issue which had gotten better after Carbondale but was starting to get annoying again. On our way out, I went back in for something and hit my head super hard at the top of the ramp. I yelled &rdquo;God damnit!&rdquo; at the top of my lungs, and after calming down felt a little sheepish, being in a church and all. I felt a goose egg form immediately and my frustration grew with it. At Harley&rsquo;s, we left our bikes in good hands while we went to find food.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/E3DCA9C3-FDAA-4611-91C2-C09156B0CD14-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/0B5764A1-166B-4D96-A956-01E3DCE0CB5A-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/E11B4535-90B9-4C91-A6D9-677DBCD23319-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>After some research, Holly&rsquo;s Sweet Treats seemed to be the best bet for vegetarian food and was a 20 minute walk down Main Street. Hutchinson is a decently-sized city with a wide main drag, dotted with big old antique stores. We didn&rsquo;t do more than window shop, as it was blistering hot and I was feeling dehydrated. Once at Holly&rsquo;s, we got some yummy salads and Holly made sure my water glass stayed filled. I iced the top of my head and started to feel better.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/A218265C-3E03-4085-89FD-04D1EEA49BF5-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/289C2C76-DBE1-4E9D-80E2-A08A38B96FD1-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/9374336E-813F-41ED-9B6D-C1CEA2F03C5F-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/5857595A-1B6C-4D18-BBCB-C1C04AF15C1F-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/BAEDC8E2-D7C3-4F08-94F9-0F5815A3EB75.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We decided we were going to take advantage of our good location and take a rest day the next day. It was mostly an opportunity to rest our bodies, as Tess&rsquo; knees and saddle sore were getting to be a bit much for her. On the short ride from Harley&rsquo;s to the hostel, it was clear that my derailleur issue was fixed! Thanks Hutchinson.<\/p><p>After a little nap we headed to the nearby Salt City Brewing Company for a beverage and some food. We had a couple personal pizzas and a salad that hit the spot. Back at the ranch we popped in Ex Machina and reclined, eventually dozing off.<\/p><\/p>","date":"August 27, 2022","fields":{"date":"08\/25\/2022","day_number":"48","multiple_days":false,"weather":"Hot","locations":{"single":false,"start":"Newton, KS","end":"Hutchinson, KS"},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"47","elevation_gain":"384","elevation_loss":"285","flats":""}}}
