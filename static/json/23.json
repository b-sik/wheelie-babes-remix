We opened the back hatch of their car and made a makeshift not-so-dry breakfast table and made coffee and tea. Emily&rsquo;s last-minute coffee cake was heaven, and I had to try it from every corner of the pan to ensure its high quality. Around 9am the rain stopped, which was perfect timing for tent breakdown. A final selfie and thank-yous to Emily and Jim, and we zoomed away towards Louisville.<figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/7F23A48D-E077-42AC-B5AD-C22BF87B923A-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/9EBCF323-84CD-4DDC-8D64-874F19EDFA7A-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1EF8FD0B-E8C8-4469-A6B8-5269079AD474-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>This morning&rsquo;s roads gave yesterday&rsquo;s a run for their money.

The Underground Railroad trail had us going along the river for quite a ways approaching Louisville, but we were stymied by the closure of the bike path.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/91F9CFDD-44FA-4924-91AF-C85C1658B08D-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>The alternate routing provided by Google was a little shorter and took us on roads with huge shoulders so it turned out fine.
