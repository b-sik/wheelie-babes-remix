{"ID":2247,"title":"Day 85 &#8211; Escalante, UT to Bryce, UT","content":"<p>We shared coffee and breakfast with Inge and Jan, once again at the Outfitters restaurant. We learned that Inge is a photographer and until their trip ran a traffic forensic team in the Dutch police. Jan had a number of consulting jobs over the years (mainly involving sustainability) and in Palestine had also founded an organization that provides education to disadvantaged children. That organization now operates worldwide.<figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/4431A2AE-7411-48A7-9A92-87E48AAC9067-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We all set off together with no expectations about staying with each other the whole way. They made a pit stop not too far in, after which we lost them for a while. We pedaled gradually uphill through a wide valley that contained a mostly dry riverbed. After a steep climb we stopped at Powell Point Vista for a snack and a breather. As we were about to leave, we saw the Dutch cycling team at the bottom of the hill so we decided to wait.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/20765879-3DF9-4C28-9EF6-3CC00C80451F-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/3E6C4C90-7559-4DFC-B373-5C4A5F7B217E-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/5434A719-43B3-4939-A4A5-5B5EDE938284-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/547F0384-F87B-46D3-A63E-6DF26B9B0C1C-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/29039160-14E5-49B2-B6CF-089467D3B4E4-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/30442D13-C081-41BA-B5E6-496CE08ED6E7-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/6680A290-30F7-4C50-A7E5-D83F6191CC67-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/75335E21-E9EC-4AD5-BC0F-C1F040542AAB-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We all rode together on a steep descent all the way to Henrieville where they decided to stop for lunch. We invited them to join us at our campsite in Bryce, where we were planning to meet our friends Jon and Christine who were coming up from their home in Las Vegas. They were game but could only communicate over Wifi, so we left it that they should come find us when they got in.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/4A54064B-3B69-4FD3-B474-A2DBF1205642-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/5A5C57FF-D51A-48E0-85B7-96C90D5B3258-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>From Henrieville it was an increasingly steep incline to make it up to the top of Bryce Canyon. Thus, it got increasingly Bryce-ey - light rock canyons gave way to weird, red rock formations.

A bike lane appeared, which seemed only to embolden drivers to pass us closely at high speeds. Finally we made it to the traffic circle where we turned south to Bryce. I&rsquo;d been there in middle school and certainly didn&rsquo;t remember it being quite so Disneyworld-like. We passed huge billboards, chain restaurants and caricatured versions of western towns on our way to Ruby&rsquo;s Inn RV Park and Campground. <\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/31135914-0241-45A4-8D6D-913D69C98555-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We got settled in at a campsite and were joined by Jon, Christine, Jan and Inge not long after (and Jon and Christine&rsquo;s little dog D). Jon made us all coffees to help us get perked up after the ride. They also delivered us a care package from our friend Colin, which included all sorts of vegan jerky! Jon, Christine, Tess and I went to get groceries, and unsuccessfully tried to get pie slices to go from Bryce Canyon Pines. Apparently they were &rdquo;just too busy&rdquo;. Too bad&hellip;we were really looking forward to trying the &ldquo;local favorite&rdquo;: sour cream and raisin pie.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/CAE1CB46-65F3-408E-86E7-CD920BA24304-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>For dinner we all shared vegetarian tacos and had a grand time. Jon and Christine were the heroes of the night, supplying most of the food and cooking equipment. We did some really good stargazing with Inge&rsquo;s binoculars. It got very cold as the evening wore on, and by the time we got to bed, full and sleepy, we were thankful to be bundled up in our sleeping bags. We had so much fun we forgot to take pictures.<\/p><\/p>","date":"October 5, 2022","fields":{"date":"10\/01\/2022","day_number":"85","multiple_days":false,"weather":"Sun, Clouds, Occasional Rain","locations":{"single":false,"start":"Escalante, UT","end":"Bryce, UT"},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"48","elevation_gain":"4039","elevation_loss":"2313","flats":""}}}
