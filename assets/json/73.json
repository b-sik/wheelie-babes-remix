{"ID":1810,"title":"Day 73 &#8211; Priest Gulch, CO to Dolores, CO","content":"<p>Woof, it was cold when we got up. Tess kindly went up to the gazebo to fetch our foodstuffs while I stayed curled up in the sleeping bag. Across the river, our weird cabin neighbors were squirting lighter fluid on the fire, sitting around it and saying very little to each other. They left loudly in their barely-muffled Dodge Charger, peeling out onto the highway, leaving their fire still lit. We tattled on them to the campground staff as we left, as that offense results in fire privileges getting revoked. We felt like we&rsquo;d just performed a citizen&rsquo;s arrest.<figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/CA3D231D-463D-4945-9D2C-4D15626D2A7F-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>The morning was cool and gorgeous, and most of the riding day was downhill to Dolores. I kind of zoned out most of the trip, but still appreciated the lush green forests and red cliffsides. We arrived in Dolores around 11am and went straight to Loop&rsquo;s Coffee House for some incredible breakfast burritos and coffees. <\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1F0104F9-81BE-44FE-A4D5-97B2FD1F5DB7-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/7E0123D1-0AC5-4C0F-ADA4-6E04F6EBC9EC-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/D9584E3D-E08B-4A90-9084-518E32902D98-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/D32918F9-A5F5-4AF4-AF9D-C7B84258D6D8-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/63D92485-857D-4199-A9A6-BDB4531735BF-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Afterwards we hit up the local grocery store, thrift store, and the old train station museum which was really interesting and had a lot of old photos from when the railroad was being built through the mountains.

As we left town we said goodbye to the Rockies. It almost immediately turned into a scrub desert. To the south Mesa Verde and the pointy Ute Mountain came into view. I&rsquo;m not sure why exactly, but I felt invigorated by beginning the next chapter of our trip.<\/p><p>The Views was the best-kept campground of the trip. It was run by a hip forty-something couple who&rsquo;d bought it six years earlier. I would have eaten off of the bathroom sinks they were so clean. We were given a site with water and electric and a nice shady tent spot. Down the path was a nice pavilion with chairs and a fire pit that overlooked Mesa Verde (hence, The Views).<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/660D13B5-4A7F-425E-97CD-B92B00E0307C-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/54F7D130-63B5-4AAF-B72E-5762858482A8-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>A few neighbors passed by walking their dogs and were really impressed by our trip. They informed me that there would be a few days of thunderstorms ahead. We&rsquo;d been getting such good weather that I&rsquo;d neglected to check the weather forecast as of late. Since Wednesday would be t-storms from dawn till dusk, I called and extended our stay at a motel in Dove Creek for one more night so we would leave for Utah on Thursday instead. Soon after, Tess made friends with the owners&rsquo; kitten. <\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/92083198-C18D-4AA2-A016-98F463399F15-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/F2E204AD-93FA-4B90-812D-BC335714411E-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.D86C9200-4A3B-4A64-A637-F739158EFC5C.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><p>Aside from the campers nearby that had a loud dog and kept revving the motor of their dirt bike for seemingly no reason, we had a lovely stay. I knocked a lot of items off my to-do list there, including some route planning and light bike maintenance. We had some veggies and hummus and little veggie burritos for dinner, followed by ice cream sandwiches from the camp office. We keep regretting our decision to send home our only dishes, which forces us to prepare food on things like old brochures.
