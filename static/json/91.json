Our original plan was to wild camp on BLM land in the Wah Wah Mountains (the second pass), but last minute we decided to just go for the whole thing. We&rsquo;d bring enough water and supplies in case we changed our minds.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/514C27-E767-4199-9F99-021CF0C56238-876x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We booked it out of Milford to put as much distance as possible between us and the hog mill. A few miles out the stench faded, and we cranked up the tunes to power ourselves to the top of the first pass where we decided we&rsquo;d take our first snack break. On the way up we passed the remains of Frisco, an old mining boom town.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/AF82CD4C-8219-48E6-B195-7030231A916E-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/5A222F51-D242-4DE9-90E6-3F6E58AED8CA-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/EBAC6B6B-5E2A-49EE-A96F-CEB918723090-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>After a Clif Bar at the top of the first mountain range, we zoomed down into a wide, completely deserted basin. Absolutely nothing around, and completely quiet. For the first time, we felt like we were <em>really <\/em>out there. As in, if there was no road and we had no bikes, we would die.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/822EC736-D78C-4D26-BBC9-C8CF3DE3121F-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/E667C010-DE9C-44B4-9729-3B91C2E28652-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.0659F8F7-E467-4847-AEA2-D842393917F4.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.974AA1E2-B01C-4A86-A818-DF9461ABA958.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><p>It took us ten times as long to cross the wide basin than it seemed like it should because the sight line was so long. The second pass was steeper, but the allure of another snack break kept us going. At the top, I pulled my chair out and we sat in the shade eating peanut butter nutella wraps. We felt good still, so we continued down into the second basin which was even barer than the first. It was quite beautiful. We saw a group of wild horses grazing a ways off.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/836B90F7-5482-4522-8B12-F9B48982F0D6-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>The last pass was the easiest, and at the top we took another rest in the shade eating trail mix. Thirty-three more miles to Baker. It was mostly downhill, and we spent most of it listening to the podcast American Hostage. About 15 miles out I was tiring out so we took a brief rest and I had a good sit-down. The backdrop was Great Basin National Park and Wheeler Peak, which we decided we would not explore on this trip.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/E4ED0741-FC0C-4096-BB29-DCB059E28FA9-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/B2BEF99F-F566-4FCC-B329-2D1C7C90B4DE-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/C69FA50E-17B9-4204-935C-F6FDE9BFD71D-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/6C3DF9B0-8314-4FD3-857F-B830368BE2FA-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/000C8A68-E7AA-48DE-BE92-62FAC9F38F65-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/687448E4-D329-40FD-BC42-C280A35E6040-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Five miles from Baker we crossed into Nevada and a new time zone! The last few miles dragged, but finally we were in the little town of Baker and sitting at a table at Sugar, Salt and Malt Restaurant. Lo and behold, they had a veggie bratwurst on the menu. Tess and I split a delicious IPA on tap, and then we had some dessert. The perfect end to a long day. We got a site at Whispering Elms RV Park and Campground, showered and then had no issue getting to sleep. After the success of today, we decided to rearrange our Nevada schedule and eliminate some of our intermediate stops.  Tomorrow, we&rsquo;d head to Ely.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/C03C36C3-4E0B-4457-B242-7C826F3754BD-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/8CDC6A35-DD01-4B3E-85B9-7EF31572B250-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><\/p>","date":"October 12, 2022","fields":{"date":"10\/07\/2022","day_number":"91","multiple_days":false,"weather":"Perfect","locations":{"single":false,"start":"Milford, UT","end":"Baker, UT"},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"83","elevation_gain":"4403","elevation_loss":"4117","flats":""}}}
