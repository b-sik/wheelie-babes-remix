{"ID":1839,"title":"Day 74 &#8211; Dolores, CO to Dove Creek, CO","content":"<p>It was 30 miles to Dove Creek and 60 to Monticello, so we opted for Dove Creek. As it stood, we&rsquo;d be staying in Dove Creek for two nights because of the storms, which would be starting early Tuesday afternoon. I was crossing my fingers that it was an interesting enough town.<p>We had some bananas and zucchini bread at the pavilion to take in the view. Amazing how much warmer it was in the morning here than in Priest Gulch only 30 miles away. We packed up and headed down the road to the Conoco for gas station coffee. It felt and looked like we were back in Missouri or Kansas. The clientele was mostly farmers, the surrounding land flat and crop-covered. We kind of felt like we were getting screwed with. For some reason there were a bunch of carnival food trucks chilling in the parking lot.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/CC629D5A-2B64-460B-B7D8-347180AA14DA-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/478FAAB8-2CA9-4621-8683-46F717811AEE-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/4D17FA93-A13C-4F7A-9794-131131F2191A-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1C886D51-62EF-4B1D-95FB-BF58AEEB9737-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>The only ways we knew we weren&rsquo;t in Kansas were: there were mountains in the distance, the soil was deep red, and there were a bunch of little hills. We had nice, wide shoulders all day which was a nice little gift. This area of Colorado consisted of mostly pinto bean farms, which was a nice change from soybeans and corn. We passed a llama that was very interested in us.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/FE3BDA3E-E23A-4F10-A01D-03F1C2628BD3-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/152FEC58-2E4D-4B3B-B5A3-7AE18F22CAED-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>As we approached Dove Creek, the sky in front of us was dark and rainy so we were glad we weren&rsquo;t carrying on to Monticello. That is, until we entered the town. It was pretty run down and bisected by a wide, five-lane highway with no sidewalks. Not the kind of place you want to take a rest day. We ate lunch at Banger&rsquo;s Bar and Pizza Place, where we waited about an hour for our pizza and salad despite being the only customers. The food was not bad, but the music playing over the loudspeakers was. We were happy to skedaddle.<\/p><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.ED245710-A3D4-459D-82F7-C29B4E128DAD.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><p>We stopped at the grocery store for some dinner stuff and then headed to the Country Inn Motel. We waited around at the office for a little bit for the front desk person to return, but when she did she got us right into our room. We had to lock our bikes in a back room because the room was carpeted. For such cheap rates, the room was pretty nice. The only issue was that the AC unit emitted an unpleasant odor when turned on. We showered, napped and hung around for a few hours watching the tube.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/8CB211EA-177B-4E54-B492-71D8F2FBA084-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>A flier at the grocery store<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/figure><p>After making some wraps for dinner (followed by Reese&rsquo;s Cups - we&rsquo;re hooked), Tess was getting a bit antsy and asked if we could get a drink at the only bar in town - Banger&rsquo;s. I was pretty against the idea as I didn&rsquo;t particularly like the vibe there and I don&rsquo;t drink alcohol. We started by going for a walk as it had stopped raining. <\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/CF9A2F50-F769-47F8-BD90-8CA167D6B61C-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/2ABF8F12-C5BA-462E-A5ED-5814C64ECEAB-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>I was pretty down about being stuck in Dove Creek so I was getting a little ornery.

Inside, there was a child&rsquo;s birthday party going on, and a few regulars sat at the bar. Tess got an IPA while I got a NA Heineken, and we sat down at a table that was also an old arcade game. Tess was much better than I at Galaga.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/55841FB9-6450-4528-904D-0A8239FD4860-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.E7875E36-A15F-4437-810E-5ACBD52DB1FA.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><p>There was some drama at the bar when the men&rsquo;s bathroom was locked and nobody could open it.
