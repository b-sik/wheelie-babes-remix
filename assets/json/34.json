{"ID":880,"title":"Day 34 &#8211; Carbondale, IL to Chester, IL","content":"<p>The stage was set for an early departure: correct alarm set, cold brews and free pastries in the fridge, early bed time. We hit the road at 7:30, not too shabby. We remembered to take a photo with Kierstin on her steps before we set off.<figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/F7F934AE-679E-4916-8E52-9AA5ED99EDAE-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>When discussing the route over coffee, we decided to take the alternate routing between Murphysboro and Chester that would bring us down to the level of the Mississippi River for most of the day. We also figured we&rsquo;d try to camp in the yard of the brewery we&rsquo;d heard about down by the river rather than the Chester Eagles Club, which would require us to climb the steep bluff into Chester (the home of Popeye) at the end of the day. We felt good about this plan.<\/p><p>The air was actually cool, it was a miracle. The route down to the river was nice and mostly flat country roads with few cars. Tess reported that her gears were shifting nicely (phew). My drivetrain had been cleaned and lubed up at Phoenix Cycles, so it was like riding a margarine chariot.<\/p><p>Down on the floodplain we watched a yellow plane watering crops against a blue sky. We got nice footage of it taking off after a refuel.<\/p><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.7E4A3A02-D4D2-4507-B7FD-10F342108BCA.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><p>Once we turned off Route 3 onto Gorham Road, the next 20 miles were dreamlike. No cars, perfect blue skies, and seas of soybeans rippling in the wind. I turned on Gillian Welch&rsquo;s Revival and sunk into a nice reverie.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/98FA16C6-E142-4DB6-9523-A5AA4EA8C6EB-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/FD6FD24B-2BCD-49CA-BA68-4F90B78136A6-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/93F92EF7-9A6E-481F-9C22-CE64F5BB3522-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/32BB654D-8993-49CD-BC4A-4428EC5A11D8-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/5D1236-4972-4742-9176-84FC66DE56E4-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/548DC3E8-1DF9-44FF-8C2F-BD2D580BED8E-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.9BD05D4E-8920-4461-9DD8-FFE34755B806.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.1C89B9DA-9BD9-4E11-BF8E-FB862085DF24.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><p>A little later on we got our first glimpse of the great Mississippi.

We pulled into St. Nicholas Landmark just before noon, which is in a big old brick building and overlooks the Mississippi. A railroad track sat a few feet away, which would soon have trains rumbling down it.<\/p><p>We grabbed a table outside and commenced relaxation. Not long after, a man named Gene came outside to ask us about our trip. He was affiliated in some way with the brewery and in no time he had contacted the owner and gotten us the OK to camp on their property. We celebrated with a couple yummy sandwiches.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/D23D0888-3DC5-4258-A2F0-4D8FD983DBEB-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>The staff inside quickly became our friends, as we would be hanging out there until they closed at eight.

I even had a little taster of the Trans Am IPA, which was pretty tasty. Here, Tess confessed she was terrified of what she&rsquo;d heard about the next stretch of the route in Missouri. I suggested we continue to take it one day at a time, and that we won&rsquo;t really know what we&rsquo;re dealing with until we see it. After all, hundreds of cyclists ride this route each year. I wasn&rsquo;t sure how well my pep talk was received. She beat me in almost every game of Crazy Eights we played though.<\/p><p>We ate some assorted sides (some delish hush puppies and sweet heat mac n cheese) and went for a walk down to the river. The evening light was great for picture-taking. We met a strange man who was taking photos with a tripod and who couldn&rsquo;t resist telling us a couple boomer jokes.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/6C47A4FB-A44F-42D1-8809-00C01D4B4819-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/816F5125-49B1-4D8E-928D-B556EC99F970-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/65FA8677-D666-4855-A45B-CD07234BE812-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/96021D52-BB98-454E-8DB2-9B81F0040EAF-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/007A4F02-75EE-4851-BB2C-04860B432E7B-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/EBD61DBD-818F-4D9C-A621-5800CA67A0D5-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/8B97F61C-E468-42F1-A2A3-FCFAF37D7FD5-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/A3908BE6-3867-4811-82D0-2DC411020D0C-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>At closing time we paid our day-long tab and started setting up our tent by the water wheel. We got some confused looks from some of the departing patrons. Earlier, the manager had said we could set up by the water wheel &rdquo;as long as we don&rsquo;t mind the frog sounds&ldquo;. What he should have mentioned was the trains that barreled through every half an hour throughout the night, or the brightest streetlamp in history that was twenty feet away. I took it upon myself to be the night watchman for us as I wasn&rsquo;t sure what the neighborhood was like, which turned out to be a mistake as I barely slept and when I did I had weird dreams about tents. What I should have done was put my earplugs in and my sleep mask on first thing, which I eventually did at 3am and got three hours of solid sleep. Hey - free lodging is free lodging! Still grateful to the brewery for their hospitality.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/CE2A9C47-DFB7-4B46-9ECD-F12A8378AAC4-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/2028C0D5-590D-4E43-BAC6-815AF48A274D-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Tess&rsquo; sleep system<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/figure><\/p>","date":"August 12, 2022","fields":{"date":"08\/11\/2022","day_number":"34","multiple_days":false,"weather":"Lovely","locations":{"single":false,"start":"Carbondale, IL","end":"Chester, IL"},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"50","elevation_gain":"646","elevation_loss":"656","flats":""}}}
