{"ID":846,"title":"Day 32 &#8211; Carbondale, IL (Rest Day)","content":"<p>We started on the early side with plans to meet Kierstin and Cindy at the market at 8:30am. Naturally, we started with coffee and muffins in bed watching GLOW. <p>Outside the market we struck up a good conversation about the fabric of American society with a stranger named JM, who had just come back to Carbondale where he&rsquo;d studied years earlier. Then the ladies and Kierstin&rsquo;s daughter Luella pulled up ready to ride to the farm, a 25-minute drive away in Anna (on a bike it would have been an hour and 25 minutes). Cindy was going to do some gardening work while we toured the farm.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/3E1231CF-5A18-458F-8BDA-0B02283CAAD6.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Dayempur Farm is on Nubbin Ridge Road, which pleases me. Kierstin showed us the herb garden (which supplies the Dayempur Herbals business), chickens and turkeys, produce garden, orchard, and apiary. We also met a couple of the interns working on the farm, and Fran&ccedil;ois, a French guy who kind of just&hellip;ended up there. He was particularly fond of the ATV, which he drove around the grounds at unsafe speeds. Also on the grounds is a small cemetery where members of the community who have passed away received a traditional Muslim burial. We enjoyed hearing how Kierstin&rsquo;s path led her to the Dayempur community.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/867C40DD-8F1B-4B85-98D4-CA77A38D853F-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1462B4BB-1A62-4091-B5DD-356E137B0772-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/F52B6684-A7A1-4633-970D-08D93968BFF0-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/53E4EAF7-804D-4B24-925C-786F98CFDC45.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/869F5517-FB81-4702-B46A-189F67D0792F.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/E8F15A02-E458-4C5F-8A54-C790C1E1155C.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1F9106B7-80D9-4E35-AE0C-8E1F8C6570E4.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/53749F5F-F931-4D32-8FFA-DD6B8DC7461F.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/18502A4B-D5EA-44D7-8503-E10F6D4B43C4.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Assorted herbs on a bed of Comfrey<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/D349CF63-2809-47F1-98AF-96AB9A11D33E.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We then journeyed down to the pond with Kierstin, Luella and Fran&ccedil;ois for a swim. The water was warm, and there were plenty of tortilla chips to go around. We were diligent about using the buddy system when in the water as suggested by Lu. It was a peaceful and relaxing end to the morning.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/D96630AA-46A4-40DE-8718-B56A71C30260.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/9225D097-194C-4736-A9E3-F739A96BA480-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/4E5D170A-0F42-4A27-9348-C49C634B3107.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>#Blessed<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/figure><p>It was getting hot again when we got back to Carbondale, so we planned to stick to our Airbnb. We made plans to have them over for dinner later. In the meantime we had some leftover salad with eggs for lunch on the porch and took a big ol&rsquo; nap. Tess went to get her bangs trimmed at some point during my nap. I had to do some work to get a finicky classical guitar in the Airbnb to play right (including using a plastic fork tine as a bridge saddle). It was well worth it to be able to play guitar for the first time in a month.<\/p><p>Later Kierstin and Luella came over and we ordered some tasty Indian food (cheese dhosa is yummy). She brought over her  favorite records which we also enjoyed. Luella was drawn to a bin in our Airbnb labeled &rdquo;80s Games&rdquo;, which contained little handheld treasures like Carmen Sandiego, Hangman, and a magic 8-ball. Quite a fun and unexpected day with some new friends!<\/p><\/p>","date":"August 10, 2022","fields":{"date":"08\/09\/2022","day_number":"32","multiple_days":false,"weather":"Overcast, Hot","locations":{"single":true,"start":"Carbondale, IL","end":""},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":true,"miles":"","elevation_gain":"","elevation_loss":"","flats":""}}}
