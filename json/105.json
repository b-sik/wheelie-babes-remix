{"ID":2746,"title":"Day 105 &#8211; Sacramento, CA to Lake Solano County Park, CA","content":"<p>The last rest day of our bike trip behind us, and only two riding days left! After coffee with our hosts and some light bike maintenance, we set off back down the river bike trail. A lot of people were out training for the Ironman Triathlon to take place on Sunday. There were a couple detours and we made a pit stop at Panera, but we eventually reached downtown.<figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/C1D2F63A-53DC-42D2-AEAC-20CDA02BCFFA-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/32E1E777-4FE5-4A34-A1AB-303A8E0AD838-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/6A04F718-E13F-4EEB-BAAA-BE60A3976CA3-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>In West Sacramento, the separated bike path turned into a shiny green painted bike lane on West Capitol Ave. We passed Hannah&rsquo;s office, and coincidentally the security guard snapped a pic of us from inside (he&rsquo;d heard about her wheelie guests).<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/2DF3DA6D-0D90-4750-8994-2CBB4273FA5F-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/2DC1F80F-F90B-4342-B8AF-2E72366283E2-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>From there we were on a separated bike path running immediately adjacent to a highway. It was pretty awful, but at least we were a little protected from traffic. We were on gross side roads after that until we got into Davis, the &ldquo;Bicycling Capital of America&rdquo;. I was a little disappointed by how much car traffic there was, but there were also many cyclists and it was pretty. We stopped at Black Frog Coffee and got some cold brews. We were totally sapped for some reason. After some dried mango and chocolate pretzels (and looking in  vain online for a cheap hotel in town), we pushed on to Winters, where I planned to get my rear hub looked at again. The bike lanes west of town were gorgeous and reminiscent of what I remember from the Netherlands.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/60C0A779-6213-41A3-AF6E-20197880009A-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/BFFA4B02-3CDA-40B5-9C1D-E00E0F25C027-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/8CEA89BB-DA22-46B5-8AD7-DB498D4920D7-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/EA2E7A15-ABA1-4401-B8F3-315E3B6F9F8C.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>The mechanic in Winters didn&rsquo;t have the bearings I needed in stock, but we hung out in town anyway for a late lunch\/early dinner at Putah Creek Cafe. I had a pretty good veggie pizza. We got really tired again but still had 30 minutes of riding to get to the state park where we&rsquo;d be camping. Again, we looked for cheap hotels in the area but no dice. We stopped at a grocery store for some coffee for the next morning and trudged on.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/012219BC-D332-4ADF-84A0-D0FBB4FC96C4.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>The last few miles were really nice - quiet country roads lined with orchards, and hills in the background. We were surprised to discover the campground had showers, and after getting checked in we got clean and enjoyed some grapefruit seltzers. Completely drained, we were asleep by 7pm. After what seemed like an entire night&rsquo;s sleep, I woke up and checked the clock - only 9:40pm! It kind of felt like waiting for Christmas morning, with our victory ride the next day. We were glad we got one last night of camping in for our last night on the road.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/F0A0BE41-7F9B-458A-A6BF-F2D539F48B76-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/E79720-D038-4883-A684-9A9EADB0C0DA-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><\/p>","date":"October 22, 2022","fields":{"date":"10\/21\/2022","day_number":"105","multiple_days":false,"weather":"Sunny","locations":{"single":false,"start":"Sacramento, CA","end":"Lake Solano County Park, CA"},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"49","elevation_gain":"768","elevation_loss":"640","flats":""}}}
