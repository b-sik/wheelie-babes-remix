{"ID":1142,"title":"Day 46 &#8211;  Chanute, KS to Eureka, KS","content":"<p>We woke up at the crack of dawn and enjoyed a cornucopia of breakfast offerings from Rick -  bagels, poached eggs, pancakes, and fresh cantaloupe and pineapple. After a selfie that included Jake we thanked Rick, hugged him goodbye and set off back to the trail.<figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/AF1360F0-E7A2-456B-AF94-64E9304DFF07-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Our first mile was on a busy gravel road and we had to squint to see through the dust in the early morning light. Back on pavement and headed west, we enjoyed some nice tailwinds again. We know they won&rsquo;t last forever, but it gives me some satisfaction after so many people were horrified that we had decided to go westward due to the certainty of headwinds.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/E0C7C474-DA3A-4660-812A-69F92F7D059C-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.CB143368-4030-4686-B35C-517004F76C73.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><p><br>After a while we turned north towards the city of Toronto (slightly smaller than Canada&rsquo;s). The roads were not in good shape on this section but there weren&rsquo;t many vehicles. I listened to some upbeat throwback music during this section which helped propel me (Matt &amp; Kim, Edward Sharpe, Tokyo Police Club).<\/p><p>After so many miles of flat, all of a sudden we came upon a really steep hill. Fortunately our bodies remembered what to do. At the top we stopped in the shade of a narrow tower of some sort for a Clif Bar.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/379420F9-B7C7-4745-B816-6D35D0080B10-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Not far up the road we had to stop for about 10 minutes to wait for a pilot car to lead us through a section of road under construction. When we were led through there were a lot of tar-covered pebbles that got stuck to my tire which I needed to remove when we were in a safe location.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/F94DEE58-C679-4C12-BCC4-62490D605476-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>There was a lot of nothing around us during this section, and it felt very remote.

It turned out to be a little underwhelming. We walked in, smiled, and greeted an employee who was sitting behind a desk, who pursed her lips and raised her eyebrows as if we had just said something extremely stupid. We weren&rsquo;t very hungry so we just got some drinks and a little snack. Fortunately the other employee Jody was really sweet. She suggested we take a picture with a lizard burger, which we obliged.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/A9AB09FD-1587-451C-9021-1C613CCF3AD8-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/21C7F3DC-8FC0-4C88-ABCF-1E75D07C573A-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/52C3DCE0-73CD-4800-8FC2-5CAA73701184-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/FCC2BC68-5350-4CD4-8EE8-0B017D5FE60B-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/9637EC0B-2A14-4CF1-AB0A-A626390A394D-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>The last 20 miles were on a busier highway, albeit with pretty good shoulders. At one point as I was singing along loudly with The Killers I felt as if I was being watched. I looked down the hill to my right and twenty or so cows were staring at me, arranged in an audience formation. I actually felt a little self-conscious and turned my music down.<\/p><p>We made a beeline to Cake Batter Batter once we made it to Eureka, a bakery recommended to us by Ian back in Houston. We had a salad, a chocolate bundt cake and a homemade oversized Nutter Butter. We got some scones and coffee for the next morning before we left and headed to our lodging for the night.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/E306C928-928B-433C-816D-127F45F62E3A-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We had planned to stay in the city park, but the day before Rick had told us about a really affordable tiny house that was right on the route. It was a no-brainer for us since it was going to be a scorcher. We were overjoyed to get to our little air-conditioned haven, and after a quick shower laid down for a nap.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/E617ACF9-F5BB-4303-A998-AF8B6792C84C-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/CED2AA17-3308-474D-A5E8-5EF4C69A5E8F-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Later we biked down the road to B&amp;B Taqueria, where we had delicious vegetarian tacos and Jarritos. We clinked our glasses to another big, successful day. Back at the house we watched the rest of Blade Runner 2049, which we&rsquo;d started what felt like years ago in Eminence.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/C0BAA80A-C9CF-41BF-BF08-735B716BB943-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/0FACCB16-AC8C-447A-B678-B4CD103ECAA0-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/53349266-ADD8-420D-A1B1-E0FDB3180464-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/778175D1-D49D-4D9A-9519-5A03D63082E4-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><\/p>","date":"August 26, 2022","fields":{"date":"08\/23\/2022","day_number":"46","multiple_days":false,"weather":"Sunny Again","locations":{"single":false,"start":"Chanute, KS","end":"Eureka, KS"},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"62","elevation_gain":"810","elevation_loss":"741","flats":""}}}
