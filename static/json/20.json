{"ID":526,"title":"Day 20 &#8211; Cincinnati, OH (Rest Day)","content":"<p>We woke up refreshed in &rdquo;Nasty Natty&rdquo; as the city is fondly called by some. Around 7:30 we wished Mark a good day at work, and I caught up on some badly needed yoga. The past two days gifted me a lot of tight muscles and a stiff back.<p>After stripping our bikes of most of their weight, we set off up some steep hills to the little neighborhood of Mount Adams. It&rsquo;s perched on a high hill overlooking downtown and the Ohio River and is filled with cute little brick houses and shops. We had coffee and breakfast at the Bow Tie Cafe and strolled around, stopping at all the overlooks.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/0C6412A9-991F-46A7-B7D4-9588959094CB-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/A880C495-37CC-466A-8F82-9D5C11DFABBD-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/81FA2D7C-079E-46AC-86B3-3F158E6C91D2-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/18221823-D7C4-4C6A-AD28-CEA8BFF3B4A2-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/D2E57904-BD15-48DF-A20A-EC61A21C8E39-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/6F69D4CD-0C74-4C02-9EE0-FCABF5FB1D8F-769x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/A1371472-C38A-4EF4-9C0E-BE77CCBA5D2A-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/47BC8CA1-D8A2-4DF0-BABF-A17E3E782B83-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/A99ABFBD-1BA2-4725-8B14-D9840C7B7E72-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/7F0D018A-4054-4222-8057-B1248CB2E95D-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Our next stop was The Garage, a bike service shop in Over-The-Rhine. The sort of temporary fix Tess&rsquo; bike had gotten in Kent was wearing off and the shifting was getting worse so we were hoping for a better solution. The shop was closed (or so we thought, we were at the wrong entrance), so we continued into OTR to do some exploring. <br><\/p><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.42B2783C-5DB5-408F-B1A6-5CE7E0BFC94C.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><p>Our first stop was Graeter&rsquo;s for some ice cream - peanut butter chip and birthday cake, both in chocolate-dipped waffle cones. We rushed to nearby Washington Park to sit and eat them before they melted all over us. The heat of the day was already starting to build. A career fair with music blasting made our sit a bit less relaxing than expected. We sat next to a splash pool that was closed for maintenance and watched sadly as waves of parents with their kids showed up only to be disappointed. Unable to take any more, we left for the bike shop, where the mechanic was set to return at 1pm.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/C80AA774-5C5D-40EE-B8F3-795E6C75CDFF-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Josh at The Garage took a look and noticed the real derailleur was bent. He said to return a while later after he had a chance to work on it. So we headed to Findlay Market in the northern area of OTR. Tess got compliments of many kinds on her tight-fitting leopard print shorts on the way there. We were there off-peak but there were plenty of vendors -  meats, spices, breads, sweets and more. We got a vegetarian taco to split.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/0D84B939-B2BF-4386-8E8A-FFFF20D90E77-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/DF31B138-6566-4B71-B79F-368C084B85A4-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/69D01A32-6885-46A3-B25C-FCC2CB5B4405-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/9D02B0BC-4F10-482D-9478-DBF98F47D73B-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We then headed across the street to Mark&rsquo;s favorite coffee shop Deeper Roots. We had yummy coffees and chatted with the baristas who were having fun exploring the many emojis that their new label printer could make. I slogged through the application process to get NY health insurance as ours is set to expire in a few days. High premium and low deductible, or low premium and high deductible? Pay more now or later? These are the ridiculous questions Americans have to ponder when trying to get access to care. The process was made extra difficult by having to do it on a phone screen.<\/p><p>Getting tired because of the heat, we headed back to The Garage, documenting all the great Cincy street art along the way. <\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/5BF7F5D6-57E0-4D40-B46E-EB8437F6244A-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/A9413D13-6D34-4FB2-989B-7C8FC55C667B-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/8BE527BF-EED0-4B28-AFDF-1BD20D263953-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/7A4C5BBA-A48D-4F6D-A837-5FBE9ECF1ED9-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/3057DA19-B12C-4F7F-97E7-7A2034B91A47-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/72EF56F1-FBBE-4EB6-8140-48FA535857CF-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/3412FF17-8089-4F59-9BF6-259E8FCE3B75.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>At the bike shop Josh had tried his best to bend the derailleur back. He suggested we get the thing replaced down the road. On our bike back, Google routed us over a section of sketchy highway. Back at the ranch, naps happened.<\/p><p>Mark stopped to get supplies on his way home for the chilaquiles meal Tess decided to make. We had local beers and worked as an efficient team. The dinner turned out delicious as always.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/D2BC2EFA-4ADC-4FB4-940B-06A6E3F1F101-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/45912698-C3D9-46C0-A6E1-78605BDC9A13-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/391869AA-B845-4582-B733-D3820C6BAAC7-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/750219E6-FB19-43CD-A5D3-E6B42364869B-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>After our meal, Mark took us out back to show us his coffee tree.

After a while, rain drove us back to his apartment. We talked about bikes, travel and being a doctor for a while - apparently, orthopedic surgeons have a reputation of having tunnel vision (see bone; fix bone). Mark&rsquo;s bedside manner was so good, we had no trouble getting to sleep.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/CE7EDE05-5277-4705-94E3-13A1FC51075B-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/84545417-2B54-4C67-B39B-CE7180B0F424-1024x769.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><\/p>","date":"July 29, 2022","fields":{"date":"07\/28\/2022","day_number":"20","weather":"Spicy","locations":{"single":true,"start":"Cincinnati, OH","end":""},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":true,"miles":"","elevation_gain":"","elevation_loss":"","flats":""}}}
