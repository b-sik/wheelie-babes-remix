{"ID":2127,"title":"Day 82 &#8211; Caineville, UT to Torrey, UT","content":"<p>Pies. Pies. Pies. Oh yeah, and a beautiful national park. On Route 24 west to Torrey we were promised the amazing scenery of Capitol Reef National Park, but more importantly the famed pies from scratch baked fresh every morning at the Gifford Homestead where they grow their own fruit. We woke up nice and early, as we were told to not get to Gifford past 10:30 if we wanted to get our hands on some pies. Also, I suppose, to have as much time as possible to see the park. We had some cold brews and Nature Valley Almond Butter Biscuits, which I happened to really enjoy. I wouldn&rsquo;t shut up about them, in fact. <figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/D3B9D2AB-5652-4F47-A450-30208A21633D-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Our surroundings, once again, were strange and beautiful from start to finish.

There was a good deal of construction on the route, and any time we had to wait for a pilot car to take us through a one-lane stretch I&rsquo;d be looking down at my phone nervously checking the time. Oh, there&rsquo;s the turnoff to Hickman Bridge&hellip;maybe we&rsquo;ll come back after we get pie. Look, the trail to the Petroglyphs Panels&hellip;let&rsquo;s try to come back and see those after the pie. I was starting to wonder if I would be enjoying myself more if the pie didn&rsquo;t exist. Would it be worth it?<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/D6A950CC-B401-4A61-8FD9-FA4EF9761BDC-1024x1004.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/E9159428-A2E6-4F3D-B778-F8D4DFC94CE2-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/AE1F55A7-8CBD-484D-9815-C9B0A70E9B8C-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/9DB1651F-0173-4422-955B-136A256CA89A-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/670D96A7-97A0-488F-9C2A-EE5EE6328AE8-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/5A1A4BCB-2FA6-42CB-923A-3A77FEBE04F4-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/5C725A90-2CCF-4B19-9575-5A3BAA568614-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/C1BCB64C-9E42-4AA2-A416-49742A7248BF-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/89C6467E-D713-42B2-B42A-6DAF8ABCB290-686x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/39AE0B94-022E-45BB-8D24-C65F848F77E5-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We finally hit the turnoff to Fruita, the historic settlement with impossibly green fields, lush orchards and massive trees, all in the shadow of colossal canyon walls. At the end of the road was Gifford Homestead, and I booked it. We arrived at 9:30, and would you know it they were still pie rich! We started off with a peach pie and a cinnamon bun. Then we got an apple pie. So darn delicious. We almost rode away without taking a cinnamon bun for the road, which would have been a massive oversight. In the field next door, horses were grazing lazily. What an incredible oasis this must have been for the first settlers.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/32F78EB0-221E-4E12-B1F1-B5E78512C282-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/616FE7E5-6F96-41AF-8AA9-AEB13D45C319-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/FF045A82-1934-4423-9B4F-A03501433D92-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/00F770C5-AE87-44D5-B500-B1A5BDE08210-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/120CC682-C6EE-41C6-92EB-C71B5DAF02FC-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/49E46911-1667-460B-81EE-7DD41E4D5A68-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/2119B755-114D-48DC-9B79-42F70B1494B9-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/801CE32A-B6F7-4F87-B7EB-55F46CA110D8-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>With pie off the list, I was much more relaxed. We decided to continue west rather than fight back through construction to get to the other sights we&rsquo;d passed by. We&rsquo;d seen so much already, and we didn&rsquo;t feel we were missing out. Save it for a future visit to the park. The vistas past Fruita continued to amaze.

We stopped at Rock Reef Cafe for some veggie wraps. The subwoofer was intense in there - a Tears For Fears song got our booth vibrating. Afterwards we biked down the road to set up camp at Sand Creek RV Park and Campground. It was a little hot, but we managed to rig up the rain fly in such a way that allowed for a breeze while we took a little nap.<\/p><p>After showers we hopped down the street to the Chuckwagon General Store where we picked up some supplies and sat out on the patio with a kombucha. For dinner we ate at Chak Balam, the Mexican restaurant across the street from the campground. Veggie tamales and enchiladas were delicious. We realized we ate a ton of food today, which we felt a little guilty about. We skipped the flan for dessert and retired to our campsite to wind down and get to bed on the early side. A rain storm was happening over the red cliffs past the edge of the campsite.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/2F38B609-BC13-41A6-94A9-59C22F5E820F-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><\/p>","date":"September 29, 2022","fields":{"date":"09\/28\/2022","day_number":"82","multiple_days":false,"weather":"Sunny, Then Cloudy","locations":{"single":false,"start":"Caineville, UT","end":"Torrey, UT"},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"27","elevation_gain":"3432","elevation_loss":"1329","flats":""}}}
