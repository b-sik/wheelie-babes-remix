{"ID":249,"title":"Day 8 &#8211; Medina, OH (Rest Day 2)","content":"<p>Years ago, Matt and I planned on having a &ldquo;guy day&rdquo; where we hang out all day doing typical guy stuff, but we never made it happen&hellip;until now.<p>We started off with breakfast at the fancy table in the backyard. I slammed back a yogurt and Matt chowed on a banana, and we both slugged some cups of coffee. A deer and her fawn were drawn to the manliness unfolding.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/FEDF384A-EABE-4ECA-90EB-FE4FF38F76F2-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>All juiced up, we hit the town. We strutted through the market in the main square, intimidating the local artisans and food purveyors. Matt slugged down another coffee at a grilled cheese food truck.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/DF7ED87B-AEE6-46AD-B53F-22A76CD9D879-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>What do men like? Pizza and beer. We hit up our girl Siri for some recs on &rsquo;za spots, then walked to each one to scope it out. We settled on Lager Heads Brewing Company, but first we had to work up an appetite with the the most testosterone-filled activity we knew of.<\/p><p>Alien Vacation Mini Golf was right across the street from Half Moon Yoga where Megan and Tess were hard at work. At a very reasonable $11 per person, our expectations weren&rsquo;t particularly high. Our minds were blown - 3D glasses, fluorescent lights animatronics, and some well-designed holes made for a great time. I got the sole hole-in-one, but Matt emerged victorious after 18 holes. Our professional grip strength and intense style of play drew many admirers throughout the course.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/396FE8AC-94D5-4615-9927-A67C7874560E-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/74F4D4DA-E286-4C1B-A8D6-E83B0315E6C9-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/CD6E9856-894C-40D6-84AF-460CD055BF18-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/A340B8AB-A97A-495E-8E2C-0B999F0C281A-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/A5705E20-6431-42E7-850F-6446AD9044C9-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>After setting several records at the mini golf course, we walked to Lager Heads for a delicious mushroom and banana pepper bar pie and some drinks. With the need to conserve our energy for the manly deeds to come, we then headed back to the Airbnb for a power nap.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/58DBA094-D35C-48FF-B690-7C6C9C70FD6D-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>After the nap we got up, crushed some Pamplemousse La Croix, and marched back into town to Medina Brewing Company.
