{"ID":2172,"title":"Day 83 &#8211; Torrey, UT to Boulder, UT","content":"<p>Back to the Chuck Wagon General Store for breakfast a little past 7am. The deli was open, so we had an unexpected hot meal - croissant egg sandwich for me, something else for Tess. The problem with waiting so long to post is that I forget crucial details like this. I&rsquo;ll never know what Tess had for breakfast that day in Torrey&hellip;<figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/971D45E3-D321-4126-8B36-8633DE80B181-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/99128A7E-3A35-4564-A54B-F1EF4F8F4F2E-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>After breakfast, Tess got talking on the porch with Jamison, who runs adventure tours when he&rsquo;s not doing search and rescue missions in his home town of Zion National Park. He had a huge bin of snacks for his clients in his van and told us to take as much as we wanted. What a sweetheart!<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/8ED97181-B180-4754-AE6B-3ABD8304758C-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We had forty miles to go that day, but a climb of over 4,000 feet over Boulder Mountain on Route 12. So whatever Tess ate, I hope it was enough fuel to sustain her. The ride started through rolling hills that reminded us a little of Italy. Cocks Comb stuck out behind the fields, reminding us we were still on the strange planet of Utah.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/7D40495D-06C4-413A-8666-EF01BE2E1395-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/432A3F01-F4F9-4249-872D-123C0F3BEF16-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/CE7582C0-09A6-4356-AFFD-B05FDBD5ADA7-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Traffic was pretty regular, and the grade got steep pretty quickly.

Right before the crest we passed a dead cow on the side of the road. I expect it&rsquo;s a fairly common sight in the area, as it&rsquo;s mostly open range. When we hit the summit I tore open the bag to get at the bun and took some selfies with it. A much larger storm was brewing to the east, so we didn&rsquo;t have time to savor it but still enjoyed it.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/0216DFF3-EC7E-4D69-8CCD-4CD8FA645CE6-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/555B0FDE-F079-43DF-B61F-3E6A74125C01-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/70E02D9C-3EC0-4965-8832-779229B6CBD3-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/0B7DF947-48EB-4629-BAD9-60A0C02F3771-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/4AEFB2E9-8E9C-4B09-9647-60E4E20F7E65-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We soon saw the beautiful sight of the sign warning trucks of the steep descent.

The host Ellie wasn&rsquo;t home when we arrived but left a welcome message for us as well as a hand-drawn breakfast menu for the next morning. It was a beautiful wooden cottage, and our room was large with possibly the most comfortable bed I&rsquo;ve ever slept on. There were several cats roaming around outside. We showered and napped, listening to the sounds of the goats and chickens next door.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/B9527205-4768-41C5-A092-6744620468C5-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/2CD242C1-771D-48F2-AE79-11972720A878-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/11445FBB-F3F6-4ED8-8E88-7673622B423A-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>We&rsquo;d considered treating ourselves to the highly recommended local farm-to-table restaurant Hell&rsquo;s Backbone, but we didn&rsquo;t really feel like leaving the cottage or spending the money (three dollar sign symbols on Google Maps).

We sat out on the patio watching the horses run next door until it started to rain. Before bed we made some tea with honey and had no issue falling asleep.<\/p><figure><video controls src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/trim.B2810B05-A68A-423C-A4A7-59C19F0CAC6B.mov\"><\/video><\/figure><\/p>","date":"October 5, 2022","fields":{"date":"09\/29\/2022","day_number":"83","multiple_days":false,"weather":"Sunny then Rainy","locations":{"single":false,"start":"Torrey, UT","end":"Boulder, UT"},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"40","elevation_gain":"4393","elevation_loss":"4570","flats":""}}}
