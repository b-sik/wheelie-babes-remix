{"ID":949,"title":"Day 37 &#8211; Johnson\u2019s Shut-Ins State Park, MO to Ellington, MO","content":"<p>We knew we wanted to go to the Shut-Ins and also hit up Eminence, where we would take a rest day and do some canoeing. We could do the 55 miles in between in a single day (which might be the hilliest of Missouri), or we could break it in half and stay in another bike hostel in Ellington. We chose the latter.<figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/81FD57-1542-4A3A-B8BA-71046C90FEB5-1024x769.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Laying in the tent in the cool morning was so lovely, we laid there for an extra hour. Our coffee stop was a whopping 16 miles down the road, and many hills were in between. Honestly, the roads weren&rsquo;t great today, though they were scenic (we entered the Mark Twain National Forest a few miles in). More of the windy\/no shoulder business. Lots of vehicle drivers seem to have a death wish around here - they go entirely into the oncoming lane on blind hills and curves. At any rate, I haven&rsquo;t felt truly unsafe at any point (Tess might have a different opinion). We only took one picture from the ride today because we were focused on traffic.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/B148F548-AFAD-4AB3-A2B6-809B43D02960-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>Our coffee stop was Cindy&rsquo;s Quick Stop in Centerville at the top of a big hill.

We had a nice little breakfast and big ol&rsquo; mugs of joe. The name of an arcade game they had by the bathroom tickled me right to death.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/11E8E306-BF0A-42C0-A1D5-93854E819AB1-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/CE9BF758-6DD7-4676-911D-E0320C67967B-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/0634D561-E9AB-40E2-AC15-4BF00E9FB759-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/524B14DD-6CC3-4870-AD37-5034CA045671-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>For Amusement Only<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/figure><p>Since it was a short day, we only had 12 miles to our destination. Which was good because it was more of the same sketchiness. The listed address of the bike hostel led us to a very closed looking Masonic Lodge. Tess captured our few minutes of confusion.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/211B900C-0625-469B-9344-450BF3AE206B-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>I did a Google search for &ldquo;bike hostel ellington missouri&rdquo; and found a picture of a little house that was visible around back. The note on the door had several numbers we could call for the code, which we eventually got. Though the hostel wasn&rsquo;t quite as decked out as the others we&rsquo;d stayed in, it had AC and a shower so we were happy.<\/p><figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/86DE6E5F-9CA2-4AD2-BC7B-1B00BD5D83EE-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/9334AF6D-7927-4116-B420-57212424139A-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/71808D8F-5028-4E36-9FF6-93FE2AF155C4-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/bsik-media.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/wheelie-babes\/1470DF36-D7EE-4370-9DA2-B9D527086101-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><\/figure><\/figure><p>After sleeping 10 hours the night before, we were still tired enough for another nap.

We made a choice then to start limiting our food intake a bit, instead of indulging in every appetite whim we have. For the rest of the evening we watched Licorice Pizza on our phone and did a little FaceTiming. We went to bed early as we wanted to take advantage of the good weather the next day and get some time on the river in Eminence.<\/p><\/p>","date":"August 16, 2022","fields":{"date":"08\/14\/2022","day_number":"37","multiple_days":false,"weather":"Rather Warm","locations":{"single":false,"start":"Johnson\u2019s Shut-Ins State Park, MO","end":"Ellington, MO"},"miles_and_elevation":{"rest_day":false,"miles":"28","elevation_gain":"1430","elevation_loss":"1709","flats":""}}}
